Food was very good.\nWe got a Chef Nuit Pad Thai with shrimp which was very good and we highly recommend it and a Khoa Soi with chicken (picture below) which was also very good. \nOverall a good experience.",

      "This place is amazing!!! I ordered a Khoi Soi with beef and every bite was delicious and very flavourful. I had their coconut breaded shrimp as an appetizer and it was worth it. Super crispy and very tasteful. The Thai ice tea is a must try as well! Super refreshing and taste so good! \n\nThe staff was super friendly and very quick service for the amount of people around lunch time. Would definitely come back here.",

      "Came here for an early dinner on a weekday; be warned, it gets really packed because the food is DANGEROUSLY GOOD! The best authentic Thai food that I've had in Toronto!\n\nI would actually give Pai a 4.5/5, only due to the slow service. The restaurant itself seats lots of people and does not have too many servers, so the service is actually quite slow (but still everyone was extremely nice and friendly). We got seated right away and did not need to wait the line since we were okay with a communal table, which was actually enjoyable since they separate your party and the party next to you by leaving an empty seat. \n\nWe ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai with Chicken! It was so packed with flavour and the portion size was really good. It was a nice blend of both sweet and savoury, with the perfect amount of peanuts and coriander. \n\nI'm excited to come back soon to try more food from their menu!",

      "My go-to dish here is the pork Pad Gra Prow which is described as \"Holy basil stir fried with your choice of ground Pork, Chicken, Beef or Tofu served on steamed jasmine rice and topped with a thai style fried egg. (contains oyster sauce) Served with nam prik nam pla sauce (fish sauce, garlic, chili & lime).\"\n\nThe ground pork has a really great balance of sweet and savoury and tastes more like crumbled sausage than typical ground pork. Breaking the egg yolk over everything, but especially the rice, levels up the dish even further adding creaminess and bulk. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, splash some of the fish sauce over everything, to up the complexity and umami flavors even further. I've also tried the crispy pork version (pictured, $2 up charge) which has small chunks of Filipino-style lechon mixed in with the regular pork.\n\nBut wait...there's more...their homemade hot sauce is so good I might just marry it. It's oil-based and has some dried-up strands of something or other (maybe shrimp?) along with spices that ups your already delicious food that much further. \n\nUsually get take out but the decor is fun and chill and makes you feel like you're in some neighbourhood bar in the Southeast Pacific. Pro-tip: if you're getting take out, head straight to the back near the kitchen and order from the little booth.\n\nClosest subway station is St. Andrew which is less than 5 minutes walk away.\n\nThe *only* reason this place gets 4 stars vs. 5 is the price. At almost $17, even at lunch, the Pad Gra Prow is something I can  afford once and awhile rather than something I'd get more regularly if I worked or lived downtown.",

      "Best Thai food hands down!  Definitely one of the best thai food restaurants I have tried. 5 stars for quality of food, the vibe and the authenticity of the ambiance. \n\nWait time:Came here on a weekday for an early dinner and still had to wait a good 25 minutes. The line was out the door and only grew longer as the time passed by. Try to make a reservation if possible. They will seat you in a waiting area where you can order drinks as well as appetizers before you are ready to be seated in the dining area.\n\nAppetizers and drinks: Appetizers were some of the most delicious thai food I have ever had. \n\nFried coconut shrimp: Quality shrimp that is lightly breaded in panko breadcrumbs and deep fried. When you bite into the shrimp, you can taste a hint of the coconut and other spices. The shrimp is fresh and soft. Definitely recommend this appetizer!\n\nSatay Chicken: The meat is so tender and the peanut sauce that comes with it is not too heavy. Tastes great and I would probably try their chicken wings next time as well. \n\nDrinks: Ordered a Thai Mojito and a sake. I would probably skip on the mojito next time as it was pretty sugary. Sake pairs well with spicy food.\n\nMain entrees:\nThe main entrees were also equally impressive. \n\nThai (green) curry in Coconut: Really delicious curry and looks great as it is served warmed in a coconut. \n\nStir fry ground beef with rice and fried egg: This was probably my favorite dish. Lots of different spices and flavours. Authentic thai food taste--I can't recommend this enough. \n\nCheck this place out! They also sell shrimp chips by the bag for $5 dollars.",

      "I've always held off coming to Pai because I thought it was always absolutely packed and that the difference in the quality of Thai food isn't worth that wait. But the verdict? After barely waiting on a weekend, the food is great here, and Pai is a great overall Thai restaurant. \n\nI was surprised how large this restaurant is. You enter and I only expected it to be a small place (think old Khao San Road) but then we got seated at the inner back area where it was a lot more bright and the music a lot louder. I was pleasantly surprised we didn't have to wait for an early dinner on a Saturday but could see the lines forming as we left. \n\nThere were plenty of options on the menu which is great compared to some other Thai options in the city just sticking with the classics. I appreciate that this place tries to offer more rustic options. Prices are definitely on the steeper side but there's a certain refinement in the food here.\n\nI had the privilege of trying a variety of dishes here. I'll start with the good. Chef Nuit's pad Thai is by far the best pad Thai I've had in the city. The balance is delectable; and the rice noodles were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of elasticity and chew. We went with the veggie pad Thai and it was loaded with tofu and veggies. It also had a nice stir fry taste (wok seared taste I call it) which added that smokiness. \n\nThe Khao soi here was around average. I've definitely had better in the city. I felt it could have been more rich but appreciated the fact they gave the pickled mustard green on the side adding to the authenticity. The braised beef was somewhat dry but the fattier parts provided better balance.\n\nI also tried the miang kung which was a betel leaf wrap. There was a nice mintiness to the leaf and a whole bunch of flavors going on with the coconut, the chilies, the garlic, and the sauces. It would be great to share but not to order as a main. I also tried the Kao pad thamada which was essentially like fried rice. The rice was really fragrant but was rather ordinary. \n\nDon't forget to order the Thai ice tea here, although pricey, it's a nice compliment to the meal especially if you can't handle the heat and soothes down your taste buds. It's creamy, rich, and sweet.",

The fried pork rinds and prawn chips that come with it are are super yummy.\n\nKhao Soi with braised beef has depths of flavour. The braised beef is very tender.\n\nPad Gra Prow with pork belly is bomb as usual. Fragrant basil with crispy pork belly. Fried egg on top.\n\nI would recommend going right when they open for lunch at 11:30am. It fills up fast.",

You think you're seeing all of it but it goes back quite a ways.   \n\nThe food is also very authentic. We had the fried squash blossoms, which was an enormous amount of very crispy delicious fritters, and a picture of lychee sangria to start. The sangria was very good and I particularly enjoyed the exotic fruit flavors. For our entrees, we had the green curry served in a coconut and  and the Pad Gra Pow. We got the Pad Grab Pow Thai spicy and it definitely seriously spicy. My husband loved it but I struggled. It was delicious though. \n\nI thought the prices were a little bit high for food was delicious, but simple. But we are in the middle of a city so a little inflation is to be expected.",

      "I've come to Pai a handful of times seeking something flavourful, and my tastebuds have never left unsatisfied!\n\nThe wait time to get a table can be long, especially during lunch and dinner time. We got here at 5:30 pm on a Saturday and waited about 30 minutes. By the time we left at 7:30 pm, the wait time was over an hour long! So definitely get here early. While waiting, you get a buzzer, so you're free to get a drink at the bar or get some much-needed fresh air without losing your spot in line.\n\nAlthough the wait time can be long, the food definitely makes up for it! We started with the Moo Ping, which is grilled pork skewers--although small, they were absolutely delicious! I had the Gang Kiaw Wan, which is green curry served in a coconut. Not going to lie, I did get this dish pretty much because it was served in a coconut, but the food definitely tasted as good as it looked! Although it was medium spice, it wasn't too much to handle. The curry's sweetness and the rice definitely helped with the spiciness!\n\nOther than the long lines, my only complaint would be the service, especially during busy times. Our server basically disappeared after almost taking our orders. Thankfully the bartender was attentive, and stepped in to take our orders and bring us the bills when we were getting restless!\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend a visit to Pai. They serve some of the best Thai food you can get in the city, however be sure to leave enough time for the wait!",

      "Ahh, the famous Pai! With almost 5 stars and over 1,000 reviews, you can't help but have high expectations. I don't really remember the names of the dishes, but hopefully you can connect two and two. Everything was quality made and the ingredients were fresh. \n\nGood\n- The skewers were excellllent. Never had skewers done that way before. They were moist and tender and the flavour was subtle but very tasty. I would order this again in a heartbeat. \n- The sticky rice that came with each meal was really well done. \n- Beef salad was yummy. The cold salad mixed with the beef was a nice combination and the sauce had a bit of a kick but really complimented the dish.  Portion is not that large considering it's a salad, left with wanting more. \n- Thai milk tea was yummy but very sweet. I liked it but I had to water it down a little as it was very concentrated. \n- Presentation of the dishes felt very authentic and everything looked delicious. \n\nThe Ok\n- I ordered the main dish that has ground meat with a fried egg on top on a bed of rice. I was okay with this. Wasn't blown out of the water and it's unfair to compare, but I prefer the Vietnamese style of the rice/meat/egg combination. \n- I think it's my own bias, but I really did not enjoy the sausage appetizer. It was dry and the flavours were peculiar and not what I was used to. \n- We sat outside, but when we were waiting for a table, the interior was quite dark and cramped with tables and people almost touching each other. If you're able to, get on the patio with good weather. It's a great experience! \n\nAll in all, really solid restaurant that gets packed in no time. My brother was sprinting to get the table we wanted and we had to have an early dinner at 5 pm. Shortly after that, the line spilled out into the streets with hungry patrons. Really recommended (but get a reservation). 4/5!",

      "The food at Pai reminds me of what I had in weekend markets in Thailand. The interior design is very chic and the restaurant is quite big. I found the interior to be quite different among different sections of the restaurant, which is always fun. \n\nIt's difficult to get in without waiting for a long time for dinner, but I find that if you arrive around 5:30, they can usually accommodate you.",

      "As i was eating there I was thinking Pai was very similar to Sabai Sabai and Khao San and then i found out that they are apparently owned by the same owners so no wonder there. Unlike other Thai places the menu is minimal with only a few options listed but the food is great. I tried their Khao San and loved it. I know it has noodles but i would still get a side of rice since i really like the flavorful broth and could still eat that with the rice. Also the bowl by itself wouldn't fill me up. Unlike other Thai restaurants that I've been too, the prices are also higher.\n\nFood: 4.5/5\nService and atmosphere: 4/5\nPrice: 3.5/5\nOverall: 4/5",

      "The experience was the complete opposite of my expectations. Was imagining a quiet, fancy-ish authetic Thai establishment with mindblowing food.\n\nThere's a patio but the inside of the restaurant is like a basement, loud music and dark, quite westernized. The whole vibe is very casual, all the servers are wearing their summer clothes aka cargo shorts and runners.\n\nMenu prices are very steep, around $16-18 for a main. We got the Chiang Mai Beef Noodles and Chicken Drumstick Khao Soi, both less than averag even when price is not factored in. Both proteins were dry...never had dry dark chicken meat before. Beef noodles definitely had a larger profile of flavours and was mildly spicy. Khao Soi was the reason we came and it was a disappointment. Didn't like the noodles and the bowl seemed quite boring, just noodles after noodles in curry.\n\nService: There were a lot of staff but yet hard to get anyone's attention. Had to wait a couple mins before one server came over so that we could tell him our order was wrong.",

      "Not exactly sure what the hype was about.  The restaurant really feels more like a bar that serves food than a serious Thai place.  On a Monday night the place was full of hipsters and millennials which in and of itself isn't bad as long the food is up to snuff.  \n\nLooking at the menu I was really looking forward to the Tom yum soup but it was way too over powering on the lemongrass and spice for my liking so by comparison the thai wings seemed a bit bland.  My entree rice dish, the name escapes me now, was average and not very memorable.  I think the reason why it has such a high number of reviews is because it caters to said millennial crowd who perhaps hasn't had too many life experiences to know that this is grossly over priced.\n\nFind a Thai place in an ethnic neighborhood instead.  You'll pay half as much for something twice as good.",

      "We stopped here for drinks before dinner reservations elsewhere and now planning to return for that good-looking food!\nBar/cocktail menu attached and everything looked good but my absolute fave was The Serge Protector!!! It's a little mezcal, a little Germaine, egg white, pepper... great combination!\nIf you're a fru-fru drinker, go with Summer Dog.. I was lured in my the fresh lychee, which was great but it's a very sweet cocktail.\nWe also tried the sangria with the red wine floater which was excellent.\nIf you have a group, get the sangria glass pitcher; the presentation with the wine floater is beautiful.\nVery friendly, knowledgeable and efficient bar service.  Hip vibe and feels like a place you want to hang out.  Such a good find in a neighborhood full of more commercial feeling/theatre district bars/restaurants.",
