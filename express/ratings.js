      "I was in here for lunch a few weeks ago, at the former original location of Guu, the place that started the Izakaya trend in Toronto. It's lost a step since those days, but is still a reasonable lunch option for the area.\n\nWe split two donburi (rice bowls), one with sliced beef on top and one with fried chicken. The fried chicken one was pretty good, the beef one was fine. Overall, very average, similar to several other izakaya and ramen spots in the area.",

      "Definitely one of my favorite places in Toronto. Came with a party of 8 for a birthday dinner Saturday night (made a reservation through Yelp) and had an AMAZING time. The food is great, service fantastic, but vibrant energy of the place is what really makes it 5 stars!! The entire staff greets you with loud yells when you come, and I highly recommend you do sake bombs bc the server will yell sake and you yell bombs and it's just so fun. They also took a Polaroid of us for the birthday, and had a sign saying happy birthday to the birthday boy! Really just such an awesome fun vibe. \n\nFood wise you really can't go wrong with anything.. my personal favorites are the salmon tataki, unagi rice, and fried Brie haha. But truly, everything is so delicious! They are small plates meant for sharing, so perfect for trying lots of different new items :)",

About 20 mins wait, we finally got into the restaurant. \n\nWe chose the tasting menu, there were 9 courses in total, $35/person. It includes Gyu Shabu salad, salmon tataki, okonomiyaki, ebimayo, karubi, kakimayo, karaage, buta kimchi bibimbap, and icecream. When the dishes coming, it seems their size are rather small, but they were actually enough for two people. And I'd say all of them are delicious. \n\nI would recommend this place to my friends and will definitely come again in the future.",

While I have now eaten black sesame desserts at various places around Toronto, none of them, no pudding or ice cream has come close to how well Kinka have captured the flavour of black sesame. The texture and feel of the ice cream were smooth and perfect, and yet, the sense was of the flavour released when biting into black sesame seeds. \n\nThis in itself is reason enough to go back to Kinka, if not for trying out the other half of the menu!",

Staff will find any reason to yell and make noise, whether it's a customer entering or leaving, or a dish comes out of the kitchen, or anything else. Definitely the kind of atmosphere that encourages you to raise your own voices.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the volume, fortunately they also have a patio that is much quieter. During colder seasons, it would be covered up and adequately heated, so the option is available year-round as long as they choose to offer it.\n\nWe came for some mega karaage. I don't know if it's on the regular menu, but they make some pretty good fried chicken. Super crisp skin, nice juicy meat. They have a waiter checking up on the patio frequently enough, with water refills and asking how things are doing.\n\nI don't know how the regular items are like, but if they've got karaage normally I'd come back for more.",

In addition we got the cheese bake mussels and takoyaki. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ramen and said it was comparable to Sensotei. The sashimi was fresh and the appetizers we shared were super tasty. The cheese mussels though are really saucy and rich- just an FYI! \n\nI really enjoyed the environment as it was fun and casual.

The staff are rambunctious and friendly, greeting everyone with a booming \"いらっしゃいませ\" making you feel immediately welcomed. Atmosphere of a modern Japanese pub/tavern, great for groups. They also have outdoor seating during the summer which is much quieter if you want to talk. Lots of interesting dishes and can't really say much more than pick what you think sounds good and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

      "Woah. This place is amazing! Made reservation at 5pm which is right when they open for dinner. It's not too difficult to make reservation and it gets crowded pretty fast (which totally makes sense) so I'd say make a reservation on Yelp beforehand if you can.\n\nBf and I ordered the $25/person set, which comes with a variety of dishes. EVERY SINGLE DISH WAS GOOD. I especially love the bibimbap - there's no meat inside, which is how I usually like my bibimbap to be, but it is so flavorful and delicioussssss! The beef is also amazing. It's grilled to the perfect stage and you really tastes the juiciness and flavor. The fried Brie cheese was a bit too heavy for both of us, but you're gonna love it if you are a cheese lover. \n\nBf says he's definitely going to come back for the season menu ($29/person) while he's still in Toronto. Sadly I left sooner - but I'm almost certain that he's gonna be as happy as this time :)",

I tried the potato fries, gyoza, and unagi doria. All were very yummy! I'll admit that the yelling the servers do gets a tad annoying throughout your meal but it adds to the overall experience. Would recommend the sake bomb, not so much cos of the taste or the alcohol but because the routine behind it is so fun.",

It was pretty empty actually with only a couple other tables so the service was excellent. Hubby had the salmon don and it was really good. Large portions of fresh chunks of sushi salmon paired with sushi rice and a really delicious sauce on top. Everyone in our group agreed the salmon don was great value. (Comes with miso soup and salad)\nThey have an extensive sake menu and lots of different tapas to try, it's a great lounge spot and hearing the kitchen yelling in Japanese to greet you is lots of fun. :)",

This is the main reason why I love coming. Their service is great. Everyone is super attentive and friendly. No matter how busy they are, they always have a big smile on. \n\nIn terms of food, I have always loved their offerings. My favorite is probably the baked oysters and the deep fried brie cheese. I think Kinka is a solid spot whenever you want to have dinner, or want to go for drinks and some snacks. However, it is extremely loud for dates. I don't recommend coming for dates as this restaurant isn't very big, and it can be quite loud whenever they greet customers who are entering.",

      "My boyfriend comes here just about every week, and I can honestly definitely see why! The food is absolutely amazing, and the staff are so incredibly welcoming and friendly! The entire atmosphere of the restaurant reminds me of the izakayas back in Japan. We came in a few hours before closing on a Saturday, and despite being super busy when we came in, we were seated promptly and were serviced right away. All the staff were extremely friendly and I really value great service so I feel that it cannot go unmentioned just how lovely the staff are! \n\nWe ordered the takoyaki, salmon avocado poke, karaage, BBQ pork belly, and banana tempura. I would order all again except the avocado poke unfortunately. As an absolute fanatic of avocado, I felt it was delicious but the only off-putting element was the cream cheese. Of course it does not ruin the entirety of the dish or my experience, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. All the food was absolutely AMAZING otherwise! Takoyaki and karaage were nice and hot and crispy, and the portion of BBQ pork belly was really big and generous, with the pork itself being really nice and juicy! The banana tempura is DELICIOUS and a great way to end the meal. Amazing food and amazing experience and I cannot wait to come back when I visit Toronto again!",

      "I can't say enough positive things about Kinka. The fun atmosphere, the delicious food, the sake bombs and great service keep me coming back! Yes, make sure to make a reservation and know that there is a 2 hour dining limit however I find that it's sufficient time. They also now have a tasting menu which allows you to sample some of their best dishes and I think great value for around $30-35. My favorite dishes are their seared tuna, fried chicken, sesame paste spinach, oysters and udon (yes, it's a simple dish but always so comforting). Make sure to finish your meal with the almond tofu -- so smooth. \nI would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a quiet atmosphere where you can converse because that is not going to be possible. A birthday celebration or a after work hang out would be better suited. They have also now opened a second location at Yonge and Sheppard -- it's more quiet however the food is just as good.",

      "I came here around 1:50pm on a Saturday, right before last call for lunch service. The restaurant was relatively empty at that time, and wasn't as loud and hectic as the last time I visited, which was nice because I felt I got to focus more on the food that was presented than the atmosphere within the restaurant. The best part about lunch service is probably their lunch options. Apart from some ramen dishes, they also serve some lunch specials like karage with rice which also comes with a side of soup and salad. You can also order from their standard menu, which has a wide variety of small plates to share. \n\nI went with my favourite, the baked oysters, I also tried their sashimi special, the okonomiyaki, fried Brie, and their karage chicken lunch special. Everything was piping hot when it arrived and tasted incredible. The sashimi was fresh and some pieces had a nice light sear to them. The Brie wasn't overly rich and had a nice mango sauce to cut through the fat. Although you only get two pieces for the baked oysters, I would say it's well worth the price-it's cheesy, which complements the oysters nicely. \n\nIf you're not a huge fan of the loud nature of izakayas, give this place a shot near the end of lunch service, it's definitely more calm. Don't give up the opportunity to try some really good Japanese food just because you don't enjoy loud settings!",

Warmth in the design of the wood through the restaurant with trendy light bulbs offer a perfect mix of modern yet authenticity in Japanese decor. Although there was a language barrier it was not an issue as the welcoming vibe of this place quickly makes you feel at ease. I had the Ramen and fell in love with the tastiness of the broth. Not too salty, each ingredient tastes wonderful. The pork meat was a bit tough for me but other than that it was great. From beginning to end this was such a great experience. I came in for lunch when I was calm and was told that dinner time was much more energetic however I found the calm environment to still contain friendliness and very good food. Highly recommend!",

It is a bit overwhelming though, the servers yell throughout your meal and it can be difficult to converse with your friends. Otherwise though, it's an entertaining and delicious spot.",

I celebrated my friends birthday here and we asked if there's something they can bring us and they brought out shots for us. They wrote happy birthday on the board and sang to her. They also took a poloroid to give to her. So nice!!! You'd think because they are so busy that the food would be just alright but the food was actually quite good! I really enjoyed every dish. Everything was tapas style so we tried to split the small plates with 7 people. Since we ordered a lot of food we were able to be full from our meal.",

      "This izakaya spot is dope. From the food to the close service. They really go all out when you arrive to leave. They do group greetings and send off every time you're seated and finish your meal. We had the Kakimayo and Pumpkin/Egg Dish with a few other dishes and they're good. Can't complain with fried/bar food. They have a fairly good drink menu from sake carafes to 1L beer mugs.We had around five people in our group and it did not have reservations so it took us like 45+ mins to be seated.\n\nI think the overall experience is where they win out. There's not many places here these days that try to provide good service and food in combination of a different experience. Please be advised, talk loud. It was hard to hear cause there is just so much going on from people having fun and chilling to birthday song being sung by the restaurant staff. \n\nOverall, it is definitely worth the wait and visit. It'll be a fun time. Make reservations and save room for many dishes on their menu.",

We got an assortment of things -maybe 13 dishes for 5 people. It was all shareable and delicious. I really couldn\'t complain about any of the dishes really. Highlights include the brie, pork belly, sashimi salad, and tako carpaccio. I would totally come back here. What a great experience!!\n\nKeep eatin-',

      "Highly recommend making a reservation for Kinka! It's incredible Japanese food, the flavors were Umani Central.\n\nWe ordered a few things to try from the menu, the standout dishes were the Karaage and the Seared Tuna. Runner up is the Yakiudon. I suggest you go with 3 - 4 people, so you can order a few items to try. They do offer \"lunch sets\", which are a great variety, but if you want to try more than .a few items, fo with friends.\n\nThe staff is super nice and the even though we came at the end of lunch, you can feel that it's a very lively place.\n\nPro Tip: be careful when eating the takoyaki balls, they will burn your mouth if you don't let them cool down. seriously super hot!! They were great but I did burn the roof of my mouth.",

      "5/5 for sure! Right off the bat, the reservations were very easy to make (made them through YELP), and they even followed up with a confirmation text a few days leading up to the event. \n\nI came here for my birthday with a few of my friends and the experience was phenomenal. As soon as you enter the door, you are greeted with an outburst of japanese waiters who make you feel welcomed. The place is not too big, hence the reason for reservations to be made. \n\nFood - As a group of 6 we decided to split and share a bunch of food items. We tried \n*Karaage - which was HUGE! It came with about 4-6 pieces and they were the size of about a small fist or less, but definitely worth it. \n*Ikapiri - calamari in sweet/spicy like sauce. They sprinkled crispy onions on the top of it, making the texture crispy, yet soft at the same time. \n*Takoyaki - octopus ball, with flour and a piece of octopus in it. Pretty flavourful and good. Presentable. Even texture throughout, but could use a little bit of a bigger piece of octopus on the inside. Be careful when biting into it, it might be a little hot!! Rich in flavour, but not too heavy. \n*Kinoko bibimbap - was better than the kimchi bibimbap in comparison, but both were really good. This bibimbap was focused on mushrooms, with a variation of seaweed. MMMM YUM! We ended up ordering two! \n*Kimchi bibimbap - very flavourful. More focused on flavour rather than spice. It's not too bad, but I prefer the Kinoko bibimbap. \n*Birthday assorted desserts - Came with grapefruit, almond pudding, 2 slices of caramel/coffee roll cake?, and black sesame & coconut icecream. \n\nAMAZING 5/5 QUALITY JAP FOOD EXPERIENCE! Defeinitely would recommend. \n\nDrinks- Try out these FUN drinks if you want to have a blast with your friends. They make it a whole experience and get everybody's attention in the restaurant. This is worth the video recording and definitely worth the try if you come here, you should get at least one of these drinks. THURSDAYS -- $3!! \n*Sake bombs - Sapporo beer & Sake shot sitting on top of chopsticks. \n*Samurai bombs - Sapporo beer & Fruity drink mix & Sake Shot --huge!!\n\nService/Environment - Excellent. Attentive. They explained very well that the table is reserved after us for 9pm which is completely understandable, and still enough time to eat comfortable. They have fast food service, and even if  you order in a trickle (different dishes) -- they can cater to it (but it's better to order everything up front). \n\n\nParking- I parked at the pay for parking right across the restaurant. Very convenient. FUN. \n\nWould 100% come back and recommend it to my friends. It makes you feel like you're in Japan, and you're immersed into their izakaya culture as soon as you walk through the doors. Please try this gem out!",

      "A Japanese izakaya featuring classic Japanese pub fare. The atmosphere is always lively and if you sit by the bar, you can see the chefs at work.\n\nI recommend sitting on the patio if you want to have a more intimate and quiet chat with your friends. \n\nYou can order a few dishes to share, or pick one of their 'set menus' for parties of two or more - which is a good option if you want to try a few dishes.\n\nSome of the items we had were:\n- Okonimiyaki -- yum!\n- Jelly Fish - a good cold side-dish\n- Karaage -- juicy and crunchy at the same time \n- Beef Udon -- decent \n- Baked Oysters with a mushroom and cream sauce -- these are to die for! \n- Salmon Tataki -- Very fresh and citrus\n- Sashimi Salad -- Fresh with a citrus dressing \n\nI recommend getting a reservation before going because this place does get busy - especially if you are in a large group.\n\nThe service was good, although it is hard to judge on this one time because I was outside on the patio and didn't get much attention (had to grab my own menus). I did come here for a bachelorette party once and the service was amazing for our 20+ party.",

      "I haven't been here since Guu days but was pleasantly surprised to find their menu hasn't changed much at all. Interior is cozy with dim lighting. The atmosphere is lively and the servers are very enthusiastic so expect lots and lots of shouting when you enter and throughout your whole meal - it's all part of the experience.\n\nFor our drinks we got the Kinka Fizz and the Sky of Tokyo - both cocktails were delicious and refreshing!\n\nWe shared the kinoko bibimbap, chicken karaage, hotate scallops, takoyaki, and salmon tataki. I would highly recommend the kinoko bibimbap - it's basically mushrooms, cheese, and rice served in a stone bowl and it tastes good! The karaage was good but I found the pieces to be too big for my liking. Scallops were so fresh, reminds me of the ones from Japan. The takoyaki is decent and you can't ever go wrong with ordering their salmon tataki served with garlic chips.\n\nFun place to go for a date or with friends! Food-wise I give it 3.5 stars because for me only a few of their dishes are memorable enough to be repeat orders - the rest are decent or average. The portions can also be rather small for the price. I have to say that the drinks are really good here though and same with the service so +0.5 stars for that!",

      "Went for lunch on Wednesday with my 2 friends. The seats were 1/4 filled and it was really warm inside. There were music/songs playing and I felt that the volume was kind of loud. I ordered the Miso ramen + Gyu Carpaccio. My friends ordered the regular size Karaage Don, Gomaae, Tako Wasabi and Donburi with salmon sashimi. \n\nI am a huge ramen lover, but honestly, I didn't appreciate the Miso ramen that I ordered. I'd rather have a ramen at near-by Kinton, Sansotei or Santouka. I usually finish most of the soup whenever I have ramen, but this time I left it half way. \n\nAs for the appetizers, I loved it. Guy Carpaccio was yummy, except that it doesn't look like the picture that has been posted on Yelp by the restaurant. I also think that it is a bit overpriced ($7.50) for 5 thin slices of beef. Tako Wasabi was good too, we could taste the octopus, and there was lots of wasabi. To be enjoyed little by little. \n\nDonburis came with a miso soup and a side salad. Karaage Don came with pieces of fried chicken and the bowl was filled completely. My friend who had the salmon one was still kind of hungry after the meal. So if you're someone who has a good appetite, go with the Karaage Don. \n\nFood: 3.5/5\nPrice: 3/5\nService: 3.75/5",

I love coming here for the food and it's worth the ear ringing after. My favourite things to eat here is the:\n- Salmon tataki (seared salmon sashimi with ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips)\n- Kakimayo (baked oyster with mushrooms, garlic mayo, and cheese)\n- Kinoko bibimbap! (rice, mushroom, cheese in a sizzling stone bowl)\n- Almond tofu for dessert!! Wow. \n\nSpecial shout outs to the ebi mayo (shrimp with spicy mayo) and the deep fried japanese squid pancake (okonomiyaki). \n\nGreat place to share foods although the price can get pretty steep by the end of the night.

The service was exceptionally slow on the night that we went but I'm hoping it was just because they were short staffed so I'll cut them some slack.  We did one of the the course meals for 2 and loved everything that we tried.  I highly recommend that \"GYU YUKKE\" - beef tartare w/ black sesame sauce & garlic sweet soy sauce topped w/ scallion & egg yolk.  Out of all of the restaurants that we tried while we were visiting in Toronto, this was our favorite :)\n\nAlso, this place gets VERY loud and you might have to share a long table with strangers but it was a very enjoyable night nonetheless.",

      "This place is amazing! My friend and I have been coming here every Thursday for more than a week for the $3 sake bombs. Every time we order one, they do the whole sake bomb chant that lights up the entire atmosphere. Pitchers are a bit pricy at around $18, but the atmosphere is super lively. This place always cheers me up. \n\nI also always get the karaage, which is similar to the one you get from Kinton (since owned by same parent restaurant), which is delicious and crispy but there's usually only 4 pieces. The salmon tataki and is delicious and fresh. If you go for your birthday, they'll have a huge board and get the entire restaurant to sing happy birthday for you, which is freaking awesome. \n\ni've also gone for lunch for their cheap $8 shoyu ramen. It's light and the pork is kind of hard to chew, but the noodles are worth the price. They also have a delicious karaage don and I don't know why they don't offer this at kinton, but it's super good!",

      "After a long nap on a Friday evening, I was looking forward to some cozy Japanese food for dinner. We made a reservation for Kinka Izakaya a bit earlier, and luckily the restaurant was busy but not so packed that we didn't have to wait to be seated in this dimly lit, but boisterous little restaurant.\n\nImmediately upon entering the venue, it was clear that the vibe was not unlike a real izakaya--a Japanese pub or tavern--you could find in Japan. The wooden decor, the dim lighting, and the small-plates style of serving all pointed to the same authentic vibe. The servers all greet you when you enter, say goodbye when you leave, and cheer when anyone in the restaurant orders a sake bomb. It's no question that it's all kinds of fun here!\n\nMy friends and I split a decent number of dishes, the most memorable I'll talk about here:\n\n-Gyu Carpaccio: This seared sashimi featured ponzu, wasabi mayo, and garlic chips on top. The meat was tender and the sauce was a mix of rich and acidic, which was a nice balance to the meat.\n-Salmon Tataki: This is the seafood equivalent of the gyu carpaccio. The flavor profile of the sauces were quite similar, but the protein was simply different. Though to be honest, I prefer salmon simply because I like fish more than I like most meats. Regardless, both dishes were quite good and the fattiness of the meat was rich and balanced out well.\n-Karaage: This is your pretty classic Japanese fried chicken. The soy sauce marinade and the garlic mayo was a nice classic dish.\n-Gindara: The grilled miso black cod was surprisingly delicate and delicate in flavor. There were some bones in the dish which wasn't much of a problem, but it was definitely a more delicate dish than what we expected. In comparison to the saba (described below), I think my friends and I preferred the saba.\n-Saba: Yum! I personally love grilled mackerel. Kinka Izakaya does a great (classic) execution of this grilled fish with a bit of salt and lemon on a sizzling dish. The crispy/flaky dichotomy was well done and flavorful.\n-Tonpei Yaki: This egg dish with pan-fried pork, bean sprouts, and cabbage was similar to okonomiyaki. Though to be honest I didn't quite like how they rendered the pork (it was a bit fatty for me), but I still thought the dish and its sauces were executed well.\n-Unagi Doria: This eel over rice as a pretty classic take on an eel donburi. The eel was well done and tasted just as one would expect, but I was a big fan of the rice. The grains felt like they had a little bite to them like brown rice, but overall was flavorful in comparison to most steamed rices that unagi is often served on top of instead.\n\nTo finish all this off, we also split a matcha tiramisu. I'll say I quite appreciated the flavor of it in contrast to the traditional coffee/liqueur flavoring, since this felt a little earthier and lighter in comparison. Looks like it's a seasonal special though, so keep an eye out for it!\n\nThis meal was a wild night and the portions were perfectly sized. Despite getting to sample so much, I wasn't stuffed! Can't wait to come back here for a sampling of their other dishes, or even their gigantic katsu they serve on Wednesday nights. Guess I'll have to make another trip up to Toronto soon...",

      "I'm a huge fan of Japanese food - especially izakaya-style dishes. So when our original lunch plans for our first day in Toronto fell through, I immediately put Kinka on our plans.\n \nMaking a reservation is super easy online via Yelp and when we arrived around 1pm, we had our pick of tables. Waitress was super friendly and all our dishes arrived on time.\n \nWe started off with an order of takoyaki to share. Honestly, it was one of the best takoyaki's I have had outside of Japan. A+ for their takoyaki! 10/10 would eat again.\n \nI had their salmon don lunch set, which comes with a side salad and a miso soup. BF had their gyu don lunch set, which also comes with the same sides. He couldn't decide on whether or not he wanted the gyu don or the karaage don, so we also got an order of the karaage on the side.\n \nThe lunch sets are a fantastic deal - you get a rice bowl with a side salad and a miso soup for $10 ($11 if you get the salmon). My salmon don was fresh and had so much salmon! The karaage was super moist and juicy on the inside but very crisp and crunchy on the outside.\n \nIf you're not a super hearty eater, one don and a split appetizer should be enough to fill you up. We both struggled a little bit to finish up our karaage. In the end, we had to leave behind some rice from our bowls.",

Especially giving how flooded Toronto is with faceless chains. Visitors seem happy (although I'm not sure if they're just scared of the waiters so they feel the pressure to smile). Whatever the reason is - keep going guys. I must also note the interior, I actually felt like an abandoned Japanese orphan thrown on the coast by Tsunami, who had to wonder across the country barefoot until she came across this fish shop that was kind enough to feed her. Yes, that's how hungry I was and yes, that's how authentic it feel inside. Big fat YES.",

      "In Toronto for business and my colleagues and I stopped in to KINKA IZAKAYA for dinner.  \n\nWow . I have to admit that I did not expect the lively atmosphere. What a cool place.  We actually heard the activity from outside the door. Not that it was over the top, but once inside it made sense. You're greeted at the door when you enter by the entire staff and bid farewell when leaving.   The staffs energy is on level 10, the guest are having a good time and there is 90's hip hop and dancehall reggae playing.  Japanese decor and food with a college vibe. \n\nSo everything we ordered was delicious.  We ordered the edamame, vegetable dumplings, kaburi  ( I think that's right) grilled beef short ribs. Salmon Tataki and Beef Tartare with quail egg (I passed on that one).  Washed it all down with two pitchers of Sapporo. \n\nIt's a bit loud and like a I said, a lot of energy. If your looking for a quiet date night or dinner, this isn't the place. But if you're out with friends and can use a little jolt to rev up your night... this is the place. \n\nReally enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere. Would definitely return when in the area again. \n\nWhoever put the music together gets two thumbs up.  I was in 90's heaven.",

      "If my tastebuds could have done a happy dance during this meal, they would have been partying nonstop.  This was one of the best meals I've had in a while-- not bad at all for a local chain!\n\nOur party of five unanimously agreed on the set menu, and there were no regrets.  It's hard to choose favorites among all the flavorful dishes, but my top three were:\n\n1) Kaki Mayo- similar to Oysters Rockefeller, but Japanese- style.  What's not to love about oysters covered with garlic mayo and a nice crust of baked cheese?\n\n2) Salmon Tataki-  seared salmon sashimi covered with ponzu sauce and garlic chips.  Voted the top favorite at our table.\n\n3) Ebimayo-  Deep fried shrimp smothered in a spicy mayo.\n\nWe also loved the deep fried Brie cheese that we ordered in addition to the set menu, because why would we pass on deep fried cheese? \n\nWe lucked out by getting seated outdoors; it was extremely loud inside.\n\nMaking a reservation in advance is highly recommended.  We tried to go back for a second meal and were turned away due to lack of space.  *Sad Face*",

The other bar is standard with drinks behind it. We ordered a few small plates and some saki and we couldn't have been happier. The food was fresh, flavorful, and some of the best raw fish I have ever eaten. Salmon tataki was especially lovely. They play old school hip hop and it just fits, the environment is loud and fun.

Ordered the blanched rapini twice because it was that good.... would recommend anyone coming here to try! We also had the tempura prawns in spicy mayo which were amazing. We tried the baked oysters, sashimi salad, octopus balls, salmon tataki, kimchi and bibimbap. Everything was flavourful and just the right flavour combo. The bibimbap actually comes in a hot stone  bowl that finishes cooking at the table. This was our first time coming here and we will definitely be back to try more dishes.

      "I am not always a big fan of Japanese food because unlike my friends I don't really like eating raw fish, something about the texture has always bothered me. However, this place offers enough choices for those non-seafood eaters that you can still participate in on the festivities and fun!\n\nThe place is very lively and can get quite loud. If you are aiming to meet up with friends and catch up over conversation it may be better to sit outside. Overall it is a fun lively place to go with friends.",

      "Smart people would make reservations beforehand as this place is packed with no seated waiting area. You have to stand like a gecko against the wall towering over tables as customers eat and finish their meal as you give them the \"eat faster I'm watching you\" look. Bustling, fun, and noisy, it's essentially a Fun place for gatherings when you want a drink and good food pairings. The ambiance is warm, exiting, high ceiling, but really noisy you may lose your voice by the end of the night or find yourself spitting over food as you try to make yourself heard at at your table conversing with the person across from you. The food is really good. The different dishes varied drastically in texture from crispy, to slimy (yes na-do& okra are slimy), to heated chewy noodles, your taste buds are in for a treat! Location is easy find as it's close to Eaton Centre and side street paid parking lining the adjacent roads. Bill will come out to approx $25 per person with table of four and maybe five plates to be shared amongst the team and one drink. Food serves are small as it's meant for social settings as opposed to eat till you fill. Would recommend but make sure you call in advance or be prepared to wait.",

      "This is a solid 4.8/5 , just not a 5 cuz the miso soup was a bit salty thats it. A lil pricey but 100% worth!\n\nWe came here for lunch on a monday, and were pleased it was quiet so we could hear eachother during our wedding anniversary celebration!\nDefinitely my fav izakaya. We ordered: \n\nbamboo sake: I'm a simpleton, but this was so cool! normally dont like soju/other hard alcoholic bevies with my food but this was smooth and tasted really nice with the fried stuff. it was $19 for 500mL (small order) but felt like more!\n\nsashimi platter: just fresh fresh sashimi. at first it looked like small portion, but every bite was great and delicious! fresh wasabi and u only need a small bit of soy sauce. I usually soak my sushi in it but not here!\n\ndeep fried brie: really great. came with a mango/blueberry sauce, but I'd have died if it was a pear kind of sauce (lovee pear and brie pairings in a sandwich).\n\nfried chicken special with tartar sauce n rice/salad: omg...there looks to be too much sauce at\n first, but with the rice it is perfect. Salty enough and they compliment eachother really well!\n\ngyu (beef) carpaccio : you actually see thickness with their carpaccio vs. allucaneat joints, and it is very tasty. no complaints here. \n\nJust a headsup, the seats are not cushioned but we didn't find it uncomfortable at all and we were eating/drinking for a good 1hr. Exeptional service but nobody else was really there hah!",

      "Not sure if I love this place.. the place is cute, everyone that works there greets you loudly as you walk in and says bye as you leave, they really try to give you a Japanese culture experience here I guess. There are three big communal tables, as well as a few tables outside, and bar seats. We called and left our names an hour before we arrived and got seated right away.\n\nI got the orange high drink? The menu says it comes with a whole orange.. it literally came with a whole orange that you have to squeeze into the drink yourself .. this was definitely an interesting experience, drink wasn't bad either.\n\nFor three people we ordered salmon tataki, sashimi salad, salmon natto yukke, mackerel sushi, yaki udon, pumpkin croquette, and soy garlic wings?(special of the night). Loved the salmon tataki! The ponzu sauce and garlic crisps definitely gave it the right amount of flavor. The sashimi salad was good but I wish they would use maybe romaine lettuce instead of iceberg. I'm not a huge fan of mackerel in general, but the seared mackerel on the sushi wasn't bad at all, I think the sweet soy sauce it had on top really helped with that. The salmon natto yukke was definitely interesting.. this is the first time I tried natto beans.. I think it's a form of fermented beans? The waitress mixed this dish together for us, we wrapped it with seaweed. The beans definitely drive the texture for the whole dish, it was all very slimy and sticky..? If that's how you can describe it. The flavor definitely wasn't bad but I believe natto beans is an acquired taste which I have not acquired.. so I don't think I'll be having this again if I return here. The yaki udon was way too salty!! Not a fan of this. The pumpkin croquette was scotch egg styled, with a hard boiled egg in the middle. It wasn't bad, if you're a fan of scotch eggs and pumpkin this is the dish for you. Really enjoyed the wings, they were on the sweeter side.\n\nThis is an IZAKAYA, everything is pretty much the portion of tapas, and they come as they are made. I wasn't stuffed, but wasn't left starving either. Overall a pretty good experience here, didn't love every dish, but all in all, this place wasn't bad at all.",

      "Kinka was highly recommended by my sister-in-law. She had already warned me that it's a very loud atmosphere, but I didn't expect to be greeted with a Japanese battle cry upon entering the restaurant (the norm at Kinka)! This is not a place to bring your grandparents, people.\n\nI liked that they offered daily food and drink specials. We ordered a few special appetizers: two pieces of wagyu beef onigiri (rice balls), salmon belly carpaccio, and yellowfin sole tempura. They were good but the other dishes from the main menu were better. We did the tasting/party menu #A (8 shared courses for $25pp). Note: this was plenty of food (we were even warned by our waiter); we definitely did not need to order the additional appetizers, oops.\n\nFave dishes: \n1. KARAAGE CHICKEN - my first time trying Japanese-style fried chicken and I like this way better than chicken katsu. Seriously, can I get that in a bucket-size?\n2. FRIED BRIE CHEESE with fruit jam dip - upgraded version of mozzarella sticks, so simple yet so amazing.\n3. KINOKO BIBIMBAP (mushroom & cheese) - for a vegetarian dish, this was incredibly tasty, full of umami flavor, and gotta love the crunchy rice texture.\n\nService was MIA at the beginning, but improved over the course of dinner. Although there were no windows or natural sunlight, the interior was brightly lit and warm. Definitely a party atmosphere - great for groups. If you want a quieter dinner experience, then request patio seating, weather permitting.",

Would 100% come back, this place is awesome!\n\nThe moment you walk in, the whole restaurant is screaming at you welcoming you.

      "Pretty solid spot for izakaya fare in Toronto.\n\nMy friend and I came for a late lunch on Monday around 1 pm. I had previously made reservations a couple hours beforehand just in case, but the whole restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived so they weren't really necessary.\n\nThey have a small outdoor seating area on their patio, which is where we opted to sit since it was such a nice day outside. I was pretty hungry since I hadn't eaten all morning, so we shared:\n\n-karaage ($9.90): a little bland but otherwise delicious. Skin was light and crispy and it wasn't too oily\n\n-okonomiyaki ($8.90): comes with 4 pre-cut pieces which makes it great for sharing. Thought this was pretty solid as well\n\n-kalbi ($9.90): a little disappointed in this dish as the kalbi flavor wasn't very strong. I had ordered a bowl of rice to eat with this but didn't finish the full bowl, since the kalbi was a little bit blander than expected\n\n-almond tofu ($4.90): my friend had never had this dessert before but he really liked it. Thick creamy tofu with a delicious almond flavor...yum!!\n\nWe ended up paying ~$60 for this meal for the two of us, which includes a miso soup and a cocktail as well. A bit on the pricey side for lunch, but hey, what's vacation for if not splurging? :D",

      "I finally got to try this place for my birthday this year with a friend. It's one of those lovely places where they yell at you with cheer when you walk in and when you leave. \nThey play hip hop and rap mostly (which I love). Really cool design with lots of wood. \nServices is great. They really know the menu, are super friendly and very fast. \nWe tried allllll the things. We went with a lot of suggestions from our server. \nI would r suggest the plum wine. Tasted a bit like cough syrup but I think it's just an squired taste. \nThe food was out of this world. \nWe got the sashimi salad, salmon tataki (so good we ordered another round), gyu carpaccio, the spicy tuna, gyoza, Octopus balls, kakimayo oysters (we ordered a second round of those too. Kind of like oysters Rockefeller), kinoko bibmbap. \nWould go back for sure!!",

      "(4.5*) The atmosphere here is more lively than the one on Bloor and Bathurst (and noiser) which was great for a birthday party. \n\n1. The tuna tataki and salmon tataki was okay (bathurst location has better). \n\n2. I'm vietnamese so when I saw their \"jelly fish\" salad I was like uh... that better be some other different variety of jellyfish or thats just what we call fish whiskers lol. No flavour and the texture was wierd like its not the jellyfish I'm used to eating and it certainly was the texture of fish whiskers. \n\n3. The Salmon Natto Yuuke NEVER DISAPPOINTS HERE (if you dont care about the slimy texture which is similar to the tako wasabi) mostly because this location does it with kimchi and okra so the explosion of flavours was just mind blowing. \n\n4. The salmon tatare was pretty good but i think it would've been better with wonton crisps instead of seaweed; would definately pay more if they substituted it. \n\n5. The chicken karaage here was the bomb so juicy on the inside and that perfect crispiness on the outside. \n\n6. The rockefeller oysters here also are so fucking good. If kinkas good at something its definately the consistency of their karaage and their baked oysters because I keep coming back for these two dishes specifically. \n\n7. Also had the sashimi salad, meh nothing special.\n\n8. The sake bombs were also okay, they were like in red party cups lol (nome is flashier and uses glass cups so the clink is so much more satisfying hahah).\n\nOverall was okay. I don't really like the variance between different kinka's cause id like to frequent one you know? I mean their consistency is done right with their oysters and karaage and the atmosphere is just right for hella hype which is great but I guess its just a preference thing eh. Different places have their own take on a dish but i hope these differences stay small otherwise why have the same name hahah.",

We ended up ordering:\n\nOden: love the daikon and fried tofu (ordered it with extra soup)\n\nFried corn: not a big order, but tasty\n\nSalmon belly and sweet shrimp sashimi: liked the salmon, but the little shrimp are just ok\n\nYaki udon: one of our favorites at Guu. It is served in a slightly creamy sauce, and the beef is very tender\n\nI always have a good meal at Guu, and Kinka was no exception.

      "WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nTheir sake bombs. It's a popular drink here! For $5 you get a shot of sake in a cup of beer. But not only that, you get to experience the fun part of having the whole restaurant get all revved up as you take this same bomb challenge. A waiter will yell sake and you yell bomb. After three instances of shouting back and forth, you rumble the table to have the sake shot drop into your beer before downing it in one go. Quite fun!\n\nTheir tapas style dishes are great too. I recommend the sashimi dishes here and the takoyaki too. You can see in my pictures what I had and I loved all the dishes I ordered! \n\nThe ambiance in this restaurant has always been loud and lively so if you're not up for that, this restaurant may not be the best choice for you. Many come here for a birthday celebration or celebrating something because the bigger your group, the more it is when you do a sake bomb. \n\nThe only thing I want to warn you is about the pace of the service. Because they are so busy, sometimes it will take a bit longer for them to get the food to you or they simply forgot about your beer order. So be patient and be prepared to follow up with a waiter on your order!!\n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nThe bill can quickly add up because you want to try everything but a good rule of thumb is to order two dishes per person to start and then order more as you go along your meal! Enjoy the izakaya!!",

      "Very lively atmosphere here with staff that are super enthusiastic! The staff are constantly yelling at full energy for whenever someone enters, exits, an order is read, someone orders a sake bomb, etc. It's truly a bustling environment that gives you a really warm and energetic feeling, but it is very loud. Don't expect to be able to speak to your fellow diners very well without losing your voice.\n\nThe food itself was sort of hit and miss. We ordered the set menu to be able to try a variety of the menu. At $40 a person, it's not too bad (note: each dish portion that comes out is to be shared with all set menu people). The items I really enjoyed were the salmon tataki and kaki mayo. The other items were evenly split into \"okay\" or \"salt explosion\" categories.\n\nI can't quite say if I'd come back again. The food is sort of overpriced for the majority of the items, considering I felt the quality or complexity wasn't there. There are a few things I would come back to try again, but I personally prefer dining environments where I have ease conversing with friends. Food is a social experience for me, so despite the lively and fun environment KINKA offers, it's really too hard to talk to people!",

Since there was only 2 of us, we only ordered a few from their staple menu, baked oysters, takoyaki, karaage, bibimbap with a pint of beer each.\n\nWhile the food came out mostly delicious, the portions have changed - especially apparent in the size of oysters, like one was significantly smaller than the other. The takoyaki wasn't crispy at all on the outside, the chicken sizes weren't similar so a few pieces came out a little pink on the inside. \n\nThe server was a bit hard to flag down, but the few times she came to our table, was friendly and helpful.

      "After 11hrs of terrible weather and driving to Toronto from Albany the wifey and I ended up in here. I have to say I was just as excited to be here as last time. However this time I was there for my Burffday and I was ready to relax and have some fun with my partner in crime. \n\nSo let's get started...Walking in here is a a warm screaming welcome so that's always fun. I was here on a Thursday and it was sake bomb night. If you end up at this place, you have to try at least once. Now I have had sake bombs at a lot of places and I'm sure so have you. But this place it's an experience you must try. It gets loud and every server gets into it and lets just say the birdffday was on its way. \n\nFood was just as I remembered it..Deeelicious for th most part. We had the tuna sashimi, the salmon sashimi, beef carpaccio to start and they were all delicious. Carpaccio was Bomb so def try that. We also got the yellowfin sashimi and wel let's just say same as above, fresh and yummy. We then got the pork belly bao buns and to be fair I am a huge bao bun snob but the pork belly was cooked perfectly and they were excellent. We also got scallop sashimi, the spare ribs and well lots of SAKE...smooth and yummy. \n\nThe only thing we didn't like was the pork dish, it seemed a bit under seasoned and happened to be cold so we had to send it back.  \n\nLastly we got the matcha cheesecake with matcha ice cream and that was mind blowing. It was a perfect cap to the meal and birthday.",

      "Want to feel the atmosphere of a restaurant in Japan? This is it!!! The food is great and everyone is jolly! We came here on a late Friday night with a party of four. This place was SO packed! The wait was going to be 45 mins but we opted to sit by the bar. Someone was celebrating their birthday so everyone was singing and taking sake shots.\n\nAt first I was skeptical about ordering bibimbap but decided to just do it. The bibimbap was delicious! The rice was crispy and full of flavor. Although the udon looked plain and boring, don't let it fool you! It's actually really good. We also got a couple of appetizers such as the salmon and takoyaki. I really enjoyed all the dishes that we had order. The only things to keep in mind are that the portions are not that big and service stinks when you're sitting at the bar (it was for us anyway).",

      "Kinka Izakaya Original does indeed taste like it would be OG.  It is five stars in my book because everything from the food to the ambiance was deserving of it.  What stood out the most was that the workers were extremely loud, but not in an annoying way.  It is part of the restaurant experience.  You will hear them yelling from the moment you walk in to the moment you order to the moment you leave.  Do not be alarmed; they are not mad at you.  In fact, they may be having the time of their lives at work.  And also, in fact, you may end up enjoying the loudness.  The drinks were delicious and strong.  The food was diverse and reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend coming here if you are around the area.  Make a reservation if possible.",

      "Warning: if you're not a fan of communal/bar/loud places, avoid this place. But if you like all that stuff, and good music, don't be afraid to come! \n\nEvery single time I've been here, the food is consistently delicious. There has not been a time that I've noticed that something is \"off\". The first time I came here was about two years ago, at the Bloor location, when it used to be called \"Guu Izakaya\". Since then, I've been here almost 30 or so times. The tapa selection is so delicious. The ingredients are fresh, especially the sashimi. I'm blown away by the specials they have every time.\n\nWhen I go here alone, I spend about $30 on myself. Which is very filling.\n\nI recommend:\n- Sashimi Salad\n- Salmon Tataki *\n- Ikapiri *\n- Takoyaki *\n- Brie Cheese\n- Unagi Doria *\n- Kinoko Bibimbap *\n- Kakimayo *\n\nAnd for drinks, I love the Cherry Blossom drink when I'm feeling frilly. Or just a good ol' pint of Sapporo. \n\nIf I have any friends who think Japanese food is all about sushi, I take them here to change their minds!\n\nThe only downside is that the service can be a little lacking. Depending on the server and the night. It sucks when you have to flag down your server to no avail sometimes. But that's very rare. \n\nP.S. This place is popular so expect a wait time on busy nights. I recommend you to make a reservation online. Alsoooooo - parking. Don't park at the expensive a$$ parking lot next door. Park on the street where the residential areas are! You'll thank me. It's Green P so you know you won't be spending a flat rate of $15 on parking. More money saved for food.",

We were seated right away and we made orders. We waited for around 10-15 minutes for the food, I thought they forgot about us since it took so long. With 3 of us, we ordered 3 dishes and one drink. We got the yakiodon (exactly like takoyaki but udon style), octopus sashimi (which really was cooked octopus), kaarage (good stuff) and the sake bomb (it was okay). The environment is very live, you'll heard screaming a lot as staff are really energetic. These dishes actually semi-filled us up which is a good thing!

      "Came here for lunch with my sister! Unfortunately, there is less variety at lunch than at dinner, and the portions tend to be quite overpriced. All lunch sets are at a minimum $10.\n\nI ordered the salmon don, which came with three pieces of flame torched salmon, and chopped pieces of salmon marinated with soy sauce. All this sat on a bed of marinated kelp, on top of the white rice. The marinade was very good but slightly salty, and soaked right through to the rice. The salmon was very tasty, but quite stringy and chewy (definitely consisted of the rougher cuts of meat). The seared salmon had a very rich and delicious smokey flavour. As this was a set, it came with miso soup and salad (which was topped with crunchy fried daikon chips).\n\nMy sister got the karaage don, which came with roughly five pieces of small karaage and a bit of lettuce. It was okay, but definitely not their best that I've had. The batter was slightly thicker than what I remember.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but not amazing. Next time, I might just come for dinner instead.",

      "I liked the food and the nice ambiance of Kinka Izakaya, but my god this place is LOUD AS HELL and it's not due to the customer but due to non-stop yelling of the servers. \n\nI came on a Saturday night and they told us the wait would be around 30 minutes, so they took down our name and phone number and they will text us when a table opens up. We then went out and walked around at the Loblaws nearby to wait for the text. It had been only 15 minutes when we were informed that a table for 2 opened up. \n\nWell this is where we made our mistake. We were lead to the bar stools beside the open kitchen and I swear I have never wanted to leave in the middle of the meal so much. The servers and kitchen staffers would YELL out in Japanese whenever someone enters, leaves or puts down an order. Apparently I was informed by my friend to never let them find out that it's your birthday because they would yell constantly while drumming. We asked the server if we could change our seats because the yelling was giving us headaches, and near the end of the meal we were seating at the bartender's table, which was slightly farther away from the kitchen. So yeah, if you want some marginal \"peace and quiet\" at Kinku, remember to inform the server that you want a table when you make your reservation.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of food and a tasting of their Sake selection. My friend who had been here before told me that all their fatty and fried stuff are the best and I totally agreed. I really liked the deep fried brie cheese and the Karaage fried chicken. Their sashimi items were really fresh away and I liked the flavour, but the portions are really small. The decorative vegetable items on the dish tasted really good surprisingly and were good pallet cleansers. My friend who ordered the Sake said they were really good and he would totally go back for some more. The bill ended up being $75 in total after tax.\n\nIn conclusion, I personally wouldn't come back to Kinku again due to the noisy atmosphere, hence the rating deductions, but I really enjoyed the food that they offered.",

      "I feel like this one is a bit tough for me to review, because I wasn't entirely sure what to expect and it took some adjusting. Kinka describes itself as a \"Japanese Pub\" and that it will \"transport you to Japan\". It is definitely unlike any Japanese restaurant I have ever been to and is unique in many ways. \n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to order the Set Menu so we could try a variety of things we wouldn't normally order. It requires that everyone at the table also order the set menu and it is 36$/person. \n\nSashimi Salad- Delicious and light \nSalmon Tataki- Fantastic! \nKarrage- Delicious, moist chicken and the garlic mayo is to die for! \nKinoko Bibimbap- My boyfriends favourite of the night. (I personally don't like seaweed sauce, so I didn't eat any of it). \nKaki Mayo- This was ok, but I prefer raw oysters so it wasn't my favourite. \nGindara- Very, very good cod. Really enjoyed the grilled miso top, very different. Lots of small bones to watch out for though.\nBlack Sesame Ice Cream- Different but a nice change. \n\nThere are a couple other items I have excluded because I don't really remember them, and I got so full that I didn't try everything.\n\nThe service was fantastic - our server was very attentive and helpful when navigating the menu. \n\nAmbience: It is SO LOUD. The servers are constantly yelling and hollering and rumbling on tables, and I admit it was not for me at first. Especially because we were by one of the server areas where they are calculating bills, so they would be literally right next to our ears sometimes. To be honest, it might still not be for me. You have to go when you are feeling in the party mood; and are able to integrate yourself into the rambunctiousness. With that being said, when everyone started yelling and hollering and waving good-bye as we left, I did start to feel as if it were one big happy family--- annnnd it kinda warmed my heart. \n\nVerdict: I would come back to try the Udon noodle dishes and more sashimi. I think that I would be a little more satisfied with dishes that are more typical of me to order. However, I don't regret venturing out of my comfort zone a bit and would definitely suggest to give this place a try!",

      "One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Think of it as Japanese tapas food. Great place for groups as the dishes are smaller and meant for sharing so you are able to try a lot of different things. I've taken a lot of people here and it's always a hit. \n\nEverything on the menu is great, but the must tries are the Brie Cheese (deep fried cheese), Ebimayo (deep fried prawns), Karaage (deep fried chicken), Kakimayo (baked oyster with cheese). These are my favourite dishes and always crowd favourites. Other notable mentions include the udon and bibimbap! \n\nFeeling boozy? All of their cocktails are great, but if you want something more adventurous get the Sake Bomb. If that's not enough try the Seven Samurai. Both options, get ready for some shots, chugging and lots of yelling! Definitely something to try at least once!",

      "If you're in any way an introvert that hates attention, OR one easily overstimulated by loud noises or crowds, I would steer clear of Kinka Izakaya. But, if you can roll with such things and you enjoy delicious Japanese food, I highly recommend this place.\n\nWhen you walk into the joint be prepared, EVERYONE gets a welcome. There's shouting, cheering and more in Japanese. A lot of the seating is communal but we were lucky to grab a table for two fairly easily on a Saturday night. We had to wait about 10 minutes but a light stroll down the street kept us occupied until they called us to let us know our table was ready. \n\nAs the name suggests, it's izakaya-style dining, which means we plowed through a large number of plates at our table. Some highlights: salmon tataki (seared atlantic salmon sashimi w/ ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips & scallion), the salmon collar, karaage (deep fried soy sauce\nmarinated chicken w/ garlic mayo), and the karubi (grilled salt & pepper beef short ribs w/ scallion sauce). But everything we had was a winner.\n\nPrice isn't too terrible either for a special night out. For the two of us we walked out of there stuffed for around $70. I've certainly spent more on less food of lesser quality in Toronto, so this was a nice surprise.",

      "This is a strong four stars. Beautiful plating, delicious stuff. It's lovely to find a Japanese restaurant in Toronto that doesn't specialize in sushi or ramen. Definitely a standout amongst the throng of 5+ other Japanese places just a few minutes from here.\n\nWe came right before last call at lunch (2pm) - they don't admit new customers, but you are free to sit there and eat. Service staff was very nice and accommodating. Blizzard happening outside so we stayed till 4:40pm without question. Fantastic service, happy & outgoing guys, could not recommend this part enough.\n\nNow, for the food. The descriptions that they went with on the menu didn't make me salivate, but the food did. For small plates, ordered the okonomiyaki (fried squid pancake drizzled with mayo & tonkatsu sauce) and takoyaki (exquisite deep fried squid balls drizzled with mayo & tonkatsu sauce). Both were delicious - especially piping hot immediately when served. Crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth soft on the inside. Fairly authentic, Osaka-style, if I remember correctly.\n\nSuper yummy, but the tonkatsu sauce + mayo was a bit overkill. I wouldn't say it drowned out the flavor, but it made the meal pretty heavy - good for feeling full, but next time I probably wouldn't order two dishes that were that similar... Sauce was getting a bit too much and we were bored and full of it.\n\nThe kaarage don was okay and on the smaller side, but nothing to write home about. Miso on the salty side, salad pretty lacklustre. Both of us have \"small\" stomachs and we were satiated, but not full. For the price, the serving sizes are mediocre, not great. We finished off with a small slice of delicious matcha cheesecake which was drizzled with chocolate sauce and presented with a dollop of whipped cream.\n\nAll in all, above and beyond for service and atmosphere, a light 4 for the food. Looking forward to come back to get my Japan fix!",

      "My first izakaya place. I went with three other people and they were full but luckily they had some patio tables still available. Staff was nice and informed us they were down a server tonight so service might be delayed. Was not a problem for the meal. Our table on the patio was in a separate are away from the yelling and bustle which was fine by me. The patio was also heated so it being winter was not an issue. The food was good but not spectacular. We got around 12-15 tapas. Some highlights for me included the udon, fried chicken and short rib. The yakitori and calamari were kind of soggy and not crispy. I would be cautioned about how loud the normal eating area is. Not the best place for conversation. Price was reasonable for what you get.",

      "@KinkaIzakayaTO #YELPTO #KINKAIZAKAYATO #FOODIE #SALMON #TORONTOFOODIES\n\nHeavy rains couldn't dampen our date night - I had a special foodgasm (and other gasms) planned. Once again, I had myself picked up; and now that we had already familiarized ourselves with each other, we touched each other a lot more. What started with a soft kiss, went on with him holding my hand while driving, as I directed him to the parking lot near Kinka. During the red lights, he either lost himself in my eyes or in my mouth - and lo and behold, we ended up missing our turns a few times. \n\nThe Church street location is really close to a $5 underground parking on Gerrard (right across from the Ryerson theatre school) - super convenient. We parked, got out of the car and I wondered aloud how we would make it through to the restaurant in the rain. He pulled me close and caught my breath in his mouth, lilting, teasing till he whispered that he had a solution; with that and a flick of his fob, he opened up his car trunk to a few large umbrellas and other goodies - usually gifts for clients, he said. How do you tell a man that you're dating that you'd really like one of those for yourself? I didn't and it's one of my biggest regrets. \n\nWe walked out into the streets, under the mega large umbrella he held with one strong arm, his other one around me. I blushed inwards; I loved how tiny I was by his side and the fact that his fingers were moving down my back embarrassed me a teeny bit. He turned towards me a few times during our walk, to pull me in for little kisses. We got to Kinka safe and un-drenched, but we had missed our reservation timing and the only seats they had available were at the bar. Also, their all season heated patio was closed as it is not leak proof. Who knew! I cringed, knowing that we wouldn't have a private spot to ourselves but we went along with it and I think it made for the BEST DATE SPOT. \n\nWe sat beside each other, very very close - and it was just another excuse to have our hands on each other. The chemistry was insane, his touch sent little shivers through my body. The date was over an hour so my body was receiving tiny pleasurable shocks through the evening. I wonder if he felt the same way. He was pleased with my pick - and he was overall impressed with the quality of service and food. As for me, I've always loved this place! \n\nI ordered a sake mojito and he ordered a bottle of Japanese beer. We bent over the menu and made food decisions over stolen looks and kisses - \n- salmon natto yukke that I've raved about enough number of times and he loved it too\n- beef carpaccio was yum\n- deep fried brie cheese which is usually good but was a bit of a disappointment this time\n- baked oyster with spinach and this totally stole the show (orgasmic) \n- kinoko bibimbap was alright\n- more.\n\nI'd like to blame it on the oysters that night, but maybe it was just us; perhaps it was the intimacy of the bar where you're forced to create closeness so that it doesn't feel too communal. While we sat and ate, the servers performed a rap battle and songs and it was super fun. We danced on our bar stools together and cheered them on. He took a video of the performance and us, and I felt more attracted to him than I ever had (if that was even possible). \n\nIt came to a point where he just could not even keep his hands away from me for a second, that's when we decided to pay and leave. I took care of the bill this time and he was super sheepish about it. I insisted - and it was truly a pleasure to take him out. BEST $100+ ever spent. \n\nWe speed walked to his car and he was happy to pay for parking. The wait of the drive to his place was almost painful after such a great night, for the both of us. Kinka will never be the same again, because this memory can't be beat.",

      "I remember the day when the Kaiju invaded my city. Monsters taller than Gojiya killing and crushing randomly without regard for life. But that didn't stop me from going to this Japanese restaurant. Wait let me stop you right there - Japanese people don't JUST eat sushi and ramen. In fact, shame on you for thinking that. What are you, racist? This place offers the OTHER Japanese cuisine. But don't expect salmon teriyaki or shrimp udon here. No here you'll get more of the creative stuff. \n\nPros:\n+ very nice atmosphere! Like a hipster fusion Japanese. \n+ menu is best described as a modern spin on traditional Japanese cuisine. \n+ all the dishes here are really, really good. You'll be dying for more. In fact, it's probably in your best interest to just get the combos. \n+ I LOVE the tofu dessert. So fruity, light, and delicious.\n+ the yelling out of orders, the new and hip pop music all come together to make you feel like you're in a Japanese seafood market joint. \nCons:\n- portions kind of small, but I am a fat American used to huge plates so excuse the F out of me. \n\nLove it here.",

      "This place is fantastic and has been one of our favourites for a long time. However they have changed their menu and took off many of the vegetarian/vegan choices. They used to have an entire vegan section marked but it's now gone. We go far less now because the choices are very limited that don't include meat or fish. If you have people in the party with dietary restrictions or picky eaters this isn't the best place for you. That being said we still go for the delicious and fresh food with fantastic service!",

      'Went there for drinks with friends after a long day of roadtriping from Montreal. We arrived there around 10:30pm on a Saturday evening and it was farily crowded, but we did not have to wait for a seat. The ambiance was amazing with the employees greeting you loudly, which can shy a few customers. \n\nSince we only went there for drink, I won\'t be able to comment on the food. We ordered a few sake bomb "for good times" as the menu said. It was indeed a good time as all the employees yelled (in a good way) in anticipation for the sake bomb. After us, a bunch of other tables also started to order a sake bombs and then started a sake bomb train. Will def come back again to try their food.',

      "My partner liked this place more than I did, so maybe it's just me. \n\nFirst, wow, this place is LOUD. I understand that the shouting is part of the Izakaya experience, but the space is cavernous with lots of stone and metal, so it was loud even when the staff weren't screaming. It's just ... a lot. I might have liked this place better in my younger years, but it's just too much for me now.\n\nSecond, we had the set menu, which was just okay. The Gyu Shabu salad (beef on greens) was fantastic. The Salmon was also good. The chicken was fine, the oysters were okay, and the fish was fine. The short ribs were overcooked and VERY salty. And the bibimbap was legitimately terrible -- we only ate a few bites of over salted rice (way too much oyster sauce) and we were done. \n\nApparently this place is \"fun,\" but I didn't get it. I'd pass, if I were you.",

      "Kinka has been my go to place for years, even in its prime days when it was called Guu.  I've had many great dishes there and to list all of them, it would be a very long review.  But basically, this is a fun restaurant to go to on a late night if you want Japanese style tapas.  Their small dishes are not cheap and if you are going in hungry, it can become one expensive meal.  However, everything we've ordered has been very tasty.  Some of their highlights include lobster sashimi (which they have in the summer sometimes), their almond tofu (to die for), and their karaage chicken (because who can go wrong with fried chicken)? \n\nThis is certainly a very loud place to be at with all the patrons talking and the waiters and waitresses yelling every few seconds when someone comes in.  It does make for a happy environment but if you have a migraine that day...definitely don't come!",

      "First of all, let me just say that I doubt there is another restaurant like this one in the entire beeping world. I would literally go back to Toronto simply to eat here. \n\nUpon walking in, the staff (and customers) yell at you to greet you. They're blaring 90s pop and hip-hop hits and seating is family style at picnic tables. It's. So. Cool!!! We waited over an hour to eat here, and I would gladly wait another. \n\nFrom what I could tell, their menu rotates frequently with specials that are flown in that day - and sell out FAST! Everything we ate was fantastic. I wish I had taken pics! \n\nThe other thing that is fantastic are the $5 saki bombs. And the fact that when you order one, your waitress starts a screaming chant that the entire restaurant joins in on - each time you order one. I felt a little bad because our server had to get another employee to lead the chant after we threw back so many she lost her voice. \n\nService was perfect. Food was impeccable.

Then she brought another thing we didn't order, however we sent this one back. The beef short ribs were delicious. The wagu beef sashimi was ok, but not what I expected.

      "This is a typical Izakaya but overall I had a just average experience.\n\nThe ambience is full of people screaming at the top of their lungs and drumming, which was pretty annoying if you're trying to talk at all. I did like how in summers they have an outdoors dining patio area, which is much better and quieter than the inside. The poor staff were literally losing their voice from yelling.\n\nThe food was standard izakaya fare. Pretty good but nothing stood out. The more adventurous sounding menu items like the fried pumpkin croquette was just heavy and weirdly flavoured. I wouldn't say bad, but nothing I'd order again.\n\nThe service was adequate since they always have a full house. We were able to get in with some waiting without making any reservations on a Friday night around 6 PM.\n\nOverall I'd rate them much higher if there wasn't so much unnecessary screaming. I get the fun and loud environment part of it but there's a limit. Having a normal conversation, we would get interrupted every minute or so when a group enters or leaves the restaurant because it's followed by so much yelling and drums.",

The veggie burger, was so good and so filling, had to take half home no thanks to the addictive dragon fries, ate the rest an hour later cause I couldn’t believe how great it was, they were kind enough to tell me what they use for the burger patty, made by Beyond Meat, their patties are packed with plant protein mostly from peas. I had to ask twice if it was meat or not because I was so mind blown. The organic wines were lovely and so were they’re home made spicy sauces. Will be back! ",

Only reason I am not giving a 5 star is the walk to the bathroom was very concerning... You walk by the kitchen through a crowded hallway which appears to be kitchen stock room. Being your clients go back there I feel your floor should be squeaky clean in the hall as well as kitchen area. It was mess! Service is a bit slow but the server rocked!",

      "Staff was very welcoming and helpful. Suggested great items and wines. The quinoa onion rings and dragon fries were delicious. The veggie burger, was so good and so filling, had to take half home no thanks to the addictive dragon fries, ate the rest an hour later cause I couldn’t believe how great it was, they were kind enough to tell me what they use for the burger patty, made by Beyond Meat, their patties are packed with plant protein mostly from peas. I had to ask twice if it was meat or not because I was so mind blown. The organic wines were lovely and so were they’re home made spicy sauces. Will be back! ",

      "First time at Fresh and I was seriously impressed with their menu, and even more so with the food. The Buddha bowl offered up the right mix of veg and tofu for me and the peanut sauce was thick and rich. The hot sauce was a great addition to my bowl and I came pretty close to drinking it. the regular size bowls are monsters so if you are medium hungry or ordering apps go for the smaller bowl. Also go do a over rice for a nearly pad Thai flavor If you want something refreshing I recommend the lemon aid, but adult beverages are also available ",

      "Stopped by here for dinner near our hotel, I don’t think we could have picked a better place. Food was presented beautifully & tased amazing, I had the chipotle chicken wrap & the other half had the mushroom tacos. The amount of finely chopped veg tasted great & was filling so I was not left hungry & made it a great value meal for when in Toronto. The locally sourced cider tasted great too.",

      "My goodness! I seriously recommend to try the vegan cheese burger. We sat outside, which I liked so I could see more of Toronto. But the burger got all my attention there. What a delicious piece of non-meat. I had to ask twice for it to be really vegan. So juicy, so meat alike. Don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily have to eat meat-substitutes, but when it is served like this, I can't resist :)If it's pricey, I don't know. I found it worth my money.",

      "I eat here at least once a week because the food is always great, their menu is huge and the service is always quick. Its a little pricey but the portions are big and the quality is good, so I don't mind paying more for a meal I know I'll enjoy. They also have half priced bottled of wine on Wednesdays.",
