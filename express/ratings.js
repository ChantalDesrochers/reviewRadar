      "David Chang's Momofuku Noodle Bar empire is built around ramen. It's what most people order there. But the real star on their menu is actually the PORK BUNS! These are by far the best buns/baos in Toronto - and my absolute faves. I have yet to find tastier ones in the city. They just never compare. These little Asian handheld pillowy goodies are so flavourful and...just melt in your mouth. \n\nWhen I lived in Montreal, every time I visited either NYC or Toronto I would always make a pit stop at Momofuku for some pork buns. I like to come here for a quick bite/snack - sit at the bar, order some pork buns and a beer, and just relax. \n\nOther items that I recommend: The Roasted Rice Cakes (great snack - spicy good), The Very Extremely Spicy Noodles (really good - BUT BE WARNED: IT IS EXTREMELY SPICY. FOR REAL!!)\n\nP.S. The ramen is ok - nothing spectacular. For ramen cravings, I recommend going elsewhere in the city (e.g. Sansotei), which are very close to the authentic Japanese experience!",

      "Delicious food and a great homage to the New York Momofuku restaurant family. I am a big fan of all the unique offerings I've had from Momo so I was excited to be visiting my family in Toronto and give this location a try. \n\nWe ordered everything from the Summerlicious tasting menu and it was all phenomenal. Dan Dan spicy pork ramen was yummo, as well as the potato and chive--very nice broths and perfect noodles. The clear noodle winner was the ginger and scallion. Mind blowing. Fresh, packed with flavor and unlike any ramen I'd ever tried. \n\nWe also had some brisket buns (yum!) and the tofu cheese (kind of weird - not for me, but not bad).\n\nLooking forward to going back to try their cocktail bar upstairs!",

I ordered the pork bun which was great! A little spice but the meat is great and the bun is so fresh. Then I got the pork ramen. It was alright. The meat was good but I didn't really enjoy the broth. It comes with this \"Momo\" paste that you mix into the bowl. I prefer a clear broth. For dessert I got the crack pie. If you haven't tried this dessert, you must!!!! It's so good!! Sweet, chewy and just melts in your mouth. The best part about this place is that if you just want to buy dessert, just go to their milk store on the second floor of the restaurant. ",

The service was amazing...our server was really helpful especially considering we were ramen newbies. I ordered the Japanese Yam ramen (sour cream, potatoes) and it was full of flavour and hearty. My wife ordered the extremely spicy noodles dish and it is actually spicy even if you have a high spice tolerance. On the side, we ordered fried chicken (katsu) and you could really taste the flavour so I actually believe them when they say their ingredients are all sourced locally. I didn't get a chance to order the okatani burger but it definitely looks like something I will try on my next visit!

      'Went with family here Friday night. We had reservations, highly recommended unless you want to stand in line. It was busy by 5.30, full. Parking was just a block away under a building, $9.00 an hour, not bad. Everything about the whole experience was satisfying from the cool and unique decorating and ambience to the amazing food and service. There are several levels, we were seated on the ground floor. They had a good bar menu and we tried some different beers. (not cheap , mind you).Beer was cold and served very fast.We had not been before so we relied on the really good server to recommend things. You must try the "buns", we had the shitake with hoisin, scallions and cucumber. They were amazing, I should have taken a pic of them. I had the triple garlic ramen, I loved it and the one bowl was a generous filling meal. We tried two other ramen bowls, all excellent wonderful flavours.For Toronto downtown I rated this mid-range in pricing. With the buns, 3 bowls and 3 beers (total) it was $90. I suppose that would be expensive if it was a small town noodle bar but what else can you get for three people downtown Toronto that is this high quality under a $100?I see some negative comments on service here, we had no issues. Staff was attentive, friendly and helpful. They have private dining and can host parties and groups...see their web site.It was a great experience and we will go back. Highly recommended.',

We came here this afternoon with a craving for noodles (which is a pretty normal craving) and walked into a packed restaurant. Unsure if we would get a table right away we were pretty pleased that they were able to squeeze us in to a spot on the front counter (or back counter? Whatever). Our waiter was super friendly, got us water, and took our order super fast. I ended up ordering the TanTam Ramen which was confit chicken with egg, scallions, sesame, and of course some noodles! When I got the dish I was pretty impressed with the size and the amount of broth in the bowl. It was extremely hot and had me drooling (not literally, I swear) after the first bite. The sauce reminded me of chicken Masala a bit and was actually pretty spicy. Overall, lunch was fantastic and I haven't stopped thinking about it since I finished. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a place with great atmosphere, delicious food, and even some ice cream!",

      "I've only had their pork buns when Adelaide Eats was on, but I will say they were magically delicious!\n\nSeriously though, I dig Chang's philosophy on food. Just make it good. The guy values food regardless of its cost or status on the food ladder. I remember an article he wrote for GQ magazine where he eschewed the merits of cheap, American beer. He said he liked the more upscale varieties too, but that sometimes nothing hit the spot like a cheap, light Stars and Stripes beer. His outlook is not one of snobbery, he just likes it if it tastes good and that of the people outlook may be why his Momofuku chain is doing so well: After massive success and accolades, he still is just the kid from the neighborhood in New York who wants a bowl of soup.\n\nOr a really fricken' tasty pork belly bun.\n\nGo!",

The pork was tender, crunchy slaw and great sauce. You must try them if you dine here.We all selected different flavours of ramen - i ordered the pork ramen; the noodles were nice and the pork belly was fantastic. My boyfriend chose the duck ramen, which he enjoyed. The chicken ramen was praised by one of our friends but he commented that the broth could be better.Love the Milk Bar concept upstairs. It’s a self serve dessert bar filled with the famous crack pie (a butter pie with oat crust) - it was delicious. Our friend chose the chocolate chip truffle balls while my boyfriend opted for the chocolate cookie. He noted that it was a bit stale so perhaps stick to the crack pie.Nice drinks list as well, I recommend the cranberry same slushie - very refreshing!Service was good, very welcoming and happy to answer any questions we had.Fun place to dine and yes, it’s more expensive than other ramen places but it was a nice experience overall.",

      "BEST NOODLES EVER! I love this restaurant, all the food is 5 star. The pork belly buns are deliciously soft and make a great appetizer. For my entree I get the pork ramen, the broth is so flavourful and not too salty. The noodles are soft and chewy and just great in this soup. It is the perfect ramen! Make sure you head up to the Milk Bar and get a cookie and some cereal milk ice cream with the crunch. You will not be disappointed by this restaurant.",

      "Had the pork shoulder garlic ramen this week, and it was delicious! The pork is very tender and the soup is garlicky-good. Chef Chang's poached egg is always on point, of course. Tried the rice cake dish this time and it's a nice fusion take on the Korean \"duk\". It had some nice crispy edges to it, my husband enjoyed it a lot and he is Korean! \nThe fluke crudo appetizer was tasty, though the fish a tad chewy for my liking, but still a light and fresh dish. \nTried the milk cereal soft serve ice cream with corn flakes, I didn't really taste the \"cereal milk\"  flavour that I've heard so much about. It tasted like a Vanilla soft serve.",

      "On a chilly Sunday afternoon, we decided to pay Momofuku Noodle Bar a visit. It was a great day for a warm bowl of ramen. I have frequented Momofuku on many occasions and have previously given the place 4 stars. However, I thought that my visit today was 5 stars worthy. The service was excellent. The food was creative and innovative. The menu has changed since the last time I visited. \n\nTo start, we had the BBQ Pork buns. The buns are a Momofuku specialty and you are really missing out on the full Momofuku experience if you do not order the buns. While there are many imitations since Chef Chang introduce his buns over 10 years ago in NYC, nothing beats the original. The buns is essentially a reinvention of the classic Chinese BBQ Pork buns. It's innovative and flavourful. We also had the fried chicken with ikura which was amazing (who doesn't like fried chicken and ikura together). Dare I say it was almost better than chicken and waffles?\n\nFor the mains, we tried the TanTan Ramen and the Tuna Ramen (new addition to the menu). The TanTan Ramen (which comes with confit chicken, sesame, scllion and egg) was flavourful - both spicy and savoury. The Tuna Ramen was a nice contrast to the TanTan Ramen. The Tuna Ramen's broth was lighter and refreshing. The noodles were lighter. It came with fresh lightly seared tuna.  The Tuna Ramen is a healthy option for those who are looking for something lighter. \n\nFor dessert, we had the famous cereal soft serve. It was a great way to end a delicious meal. While there are many other ramen places around town, Momofuku is more than a ramen shop. Come for the ramen but try the other dishes. You also do not feel like the wait stuff is rushing you out at Momofuku to turn the table. Momofuku is an experience. It is more than just a warm bowl of ramen.",

      "We went on a Monday around 12:30 pm and it was surprisingly not too busy. We came here for lunch based on recommendations from a friend.There are two floors - the upstairs is the Milk bar (cookie/pastry area) while the downstairs is the dining area.The decor is modern and hipster with wood and large art on the walls. Service was a little slow but friendly and clearly familiar with the menu when asked questions.The food itself was a let down however. We had the triple garlic pork ramen, the okonomiyaki and the tsukemen noodles. The okonomiyaki was a little thin but tasted ok. The ramen broth tasted good but it had maybe only 3 pieces of meat in the entire bowl. The tsukemen dipping sauce was oddly thick and spicy while the noodles were extremely oily to the point that my entire mouth felt like it was coated with a film on every bite.Overall, we were disappointed given the name reputation and recommendation. It is worth a visit just to be able to say you tried it but I personally would not go again.",

      "After a so-so experience and review for Momofuku Winterlicious, the manager connected with me, inviting me to return with my friend (she also had some issues with our first meal, but was happy to give them a second chance). \n\nI'm delighted to say that our meal today far surpassed our previous experience. We started with a fresh new cocktail the bar was experimenting with, called the Urbanite, featuring rosemary syrup, gin, and lemon or lime. It was a perfect light start to the meal.\n\nAppetizer highlights included two types of buns: Chicken Meatball - ssam sauce,  smoked pickle, iceberg, and Pork Belly - hoisin, scallion, cucumber. I can't say I had a favourite because both were equally delicious! Definitely worth a repeat visit.\n\nFor mains, I had the Ginger Scallion Noodles - pickled shiitake, cucumber, cabbage, and katsu chicken, and my friend had the TanTan Ramen - confit chicken, sesame, scallion, egg. Both dishes were a home run, especially compared to our Winterlicious experience. I was sorry I was too full to finish this (had to leave enough room for SOME dessert). But seriously, I would absolutely order the same dish next time--I loved the combination of flavours and veggies.\n\nDessert from Milk Bar was a repeat success--they're true masters of the sugar fix. We had their famous Crack Pie (it's every bit as good as I expected it would be) and their Crack Pie soft serve ice cream with cornflake sprinkles (OMG sooo tasty). My friend, who clearly has a genius for taking dessert to the next level, suggested we put the rest of the soft serve on top of the Crack Pie. Just. Amazing. Sugar. Coma. Love.  \n\nIf I were to offer one piece of feedback, it would be that they offer more of their 'classic' menu items during 'licious events. They don't have a long menu, and it seems all of the items on there have been mastered as proven palate pleasers. For people who make a point of trying new places during 'licious events, it's a great idea for restaurants to let their culinary strengths shine for newcomers, especially when those strenghts include delicious steamed buns and Crack pie!",

      "Having tried many ramen places all over the world, I have to say, I had some high hopes for Momofuku in Toronto. The Noodle Bar doesn't accept reservations, which I'm fine with since there was no one waiting and got a seat promptly. The napa kimchi was really good...albeit CA$7 was a little steep for the portion size. Can't mess up kimchi anyway.Had the pork ramen and the broth is divine! David Chang wasn't joking when he said a lot of time and love goes into that broth. The egg - which if you've seen 'Mind of a Chef' - was surprisingly not that great. It was cold and although it was like a soft poached egg, the yolk certainly doesn't run (it held it's round shape when I cut it open). Noodles were clumped together and the texture of the noodles were okay. For CA$16 a bowl, I expected better. The service is prompt, and friendly (but not overly friendly) and if you're short on time, the Noodle Bar is definitely a great option. ",

      "This is one of my all-time favorite spots in Toronto, and I think is worth the drive from Buffalo.  I don't understand all of the low reviews!  It's important to note that in order to get in in a timely fashion, you HAVE to make a reservation.  Over the past several years, I have made reservations and always been seated before or on-time.  I have always had excellent customer service from the staff and never a long wait for my food.\nAs far as the food goes, above everything else, you HAVE to order a pair of the pork buns!  Those fluffy steamed buns and the tender slices of pork belly...I can't.  It's a magical few bites that you will thank me for suggesting later.  Also, if the beef brisket bun happens to be on the menu that evening, that's very delicious and tender as well!  And there's a pickle in there!\nMy other favorite classic staple to order is the pork ramen.  Again with the tender pork belly slices but also with a poached egg, delicious broth, it's like a classic noodle dish with a modern twist.  It fills you up without leaving you TOO full, so you can still go out and enjoy the rest of your evening.\nThere is also an extensive beer and wine and cider list, and a little bar upstairs!  And don't forget to check out the Milk Bar and take a Crack Pie home.\nMomofuku is honestly more than just a resturant, it's an experience...and one you do not want to pass up.",

We had the pork belly buns - so so good, fatty, juicy, and soft, as well as the yuzu ramen and the pork ramen. Both were delicious, although the citrus one was very citrusy and fresh tasting and might not be enjoyed by those who prefer a more traditional taste. Overall, very good experience, by not the best ramen we've ever had. On a side note, the milk bar right upstairs had some nice cookies and pie and the soft serve cereal milk ice cream is bomb!!!! Honestly I would come back just for the ice cream.",

      "Need to satisfy a pork belly craving? Order the pork buns and ramen. 2 thick cut pieces are piled into a squishy bun with cucumber, green onions and hoisin sauce. The pairing of the melt in your mouth pork belly with the crunch from the cucumber is a definite winner.\n\nThe ramen is beautifully presented. What I love about this ramen most is the texture of the noodles and that pork belly goodness. I also really enjoy the soft poached egg and wish that all ramen joints would move to poached eggs, instead of hard boiled. Mixing the yolk into the broth provides a creamy mouthfeel and added flavour. \n\nThis ramen closely competes with some of the top of the city. I will be back the next time I am craving pork belly.",

      "Long and overdue re-review. \n\n4.5 stars - Momofuku graciously invited me back, and I was a lot more happy with the service and food I received. I came here with my sister, who had never been to Momofuku, to try some of their foods. \n\nWe were seated on the second floor, which offered a gorgeous view of the outside. I'm not sure if this is available for normal visitors, but I loved dining from an elevated position that allowed us to people watch.\n\nWe ordered the roasted rice cakes, pork buns, ginger scallion noodles, and they also presented us with a special dish - their twist in Korean bbq.\n\nThe roasted rice cakes had an amazing texture. The crispness of the outside paired with the pillowy inside of the rice cakes made for an amazing appetizer. It was a little under seasoned though, and I almost found myself wishing that there was a dip for it on the side perhaps.\n\nThe pork buns, as always, were simply amazing. This is hands-down the best item on their menu. I know people rave about it constantly, but if you need to choose something to order, try their buns!! My sister was wide-eyed when she had one and loved it.\n\nThe ginger scallion noodles were tasty, but greasy. The noodle texture had a great elasticity and provide a good bite. The seasoning itself, on first bite, was amazing. However, I felt that it could use more ginger to provide more to the dish. After 2 or 3 bites, the oil starts coating your mouth, so the flavour of ginger would really help to reset your palate. There just wasn't enough ginger to help cut through the grease.\n\nThe cold Korean bbq was beautifully presented, and in a fun DIY manner that it's known for. It was served with gochujang on the platter, a medium rare steak, and vibrant greens. The steak was beautifully cooked, but again, it could've used another punch of flavour. The steak wasn't seasoned well enough for that extra impact. I feel like this could've pushed it over the edge if it had slightly better seasoning.\n\nWe also had drinks with our meal, the paper crane and a melon drink. Paper crane was a bit too alcoholic for my tastes, but the melon drink was a fantastic one. I'd also like to add that our service was AMAZING! Shout out to our waitress!\n\nOur meal ended with their famous cereal milk soft serve, which I always get when I visit. \n\nOverall, service was amazing, ambience was amazing, and the food just needed some minor tweaking for my tastes. Apart from that, I am super excited to come back and visit again now that I know what to order with confidence.",

Quite a selection of speciality cocktails, but I stuck to Tiger beer; served beer within two minutes of sitting down, placed order for food and that was delivered in less than ten minutes. The pork buns were very tender and tasty, nice contrasting textures. The Ramen was amazing, lots of perfectly cooked noodles, tender pork belly, soft egg and beautifully balanced broth.

      "As a professional foodie, I have to rate this restaurant as full star. The dishes are quite unique and delicious. The chef combined different cooking skills into one dish, so you may think the foods are really unique. The noodles is quite delicious and the steam bao pork is fabulous! You can actually note that the pork are freshly cooked. The ice cream tastes great as well. \n\nI would recommend just stay at the noodles bar. I went to the third floor once. They served more high-ended food in the third floor, so the price levels are pretty high. While the dishes were just ok, I would go to Bosk for the same price level. (BTW bosk is right next door.) The salad tasted great and the seafood were fresh. plz dress up if you want to go to third floor. Otherwise, you will look awkward... since everyone dresses up in this floor. \n\nGenerally speaking, Definitely highly recommend!",

      "Note: this review pertains to Momofuku's 2018 Winterlicious menu.\n\nThe first time I ever ate at Momofuku was Summerlicious 2014, so naturally I had to come back 3.5 years later for Winterlicious as well. \n\nWe had reservations for 12:15 and service promptly seated us at a communal table.\n\nOnto the food:\n\nAPPETIZERS\nThe bun is soft and pillowy, and the BBQ pork is so delicious and tender accompanied with the coleslaw.\nMy friend's shiitake bun was a bit too sweet for our liking.\n\nMAIN\nThe Pork ramen is unparalleled and absolutely divine. The pork belly is fatty and melts in your mouth, and the meat is so tender and flavourful. I really liked the broth. Also, this may sound gross to those of you who don't like raw egg, but my friend found (and I agreed) that mixing the egg yolk (it is still liquid) in with the soup makes it taste richer. Just our two cents.\n\nDESSERT\nSugar fanatics, this one's for you: They're offering up a trio of desserts created by Christina Tosi herself, the founder of Milk Bar. We opted for the crack pie, which is has an oat cookie crust with a gooey caramel/toffee-like butter filling. I can say with absolute certainty that it ranks in the top 5 desserts I've ever had.\n\n$30 well spent. Come here for lunch before Winterlicious ends (February 8)!",

      "Came with 3 other family members for lunch to share what seemed like half the menu. We all thought everything was very good and would definitely recommend coming. If you are not comfortable in tight spots, be warned, seating is crowded (majority tables are like long picnic tables), and you will likely get seated next to strangers. No biggie for us cuz we just like good food.\n\nAll ramen comes with an onsen egg. In the South where I live the egg is usually an ajitama soft boiled egg. I love both kinds! \n\nFried beef tendon: straight up look like pork rinds drizzled with sauce. You can tell it's different though because it's much softer than pork rinds, and has a more subtle flavor.\n\nPork ramen: easily the group favorite, great flavor, lots of umami. Pork belly was super tender. \n\nGarlic ramen: group also loved, and lives up the name as the garlic was heavy and oh so delicious. Bring some gum for after if you eat this! \n\nGinger scallion ramen: reminded us of the chinese ginger scallion sauce that comes with chicken, but not as salty. Definitely loved this dish as well. Was the first to be finished. We got it with katsu chicken and was totally a good call. \n\nChicken ramen: pretty good, but seemed almost bland compared to the other ramen. We did think the fried chicken skins were a nice touch. Overall, however, leaves you feeling like something is missing.\n\nCrack pie: super rich butterscotch pie with sticky caramel-like (maybe it was caramel?) coating almost all around including the crust. Was sooooo good. But as I'm not super into sweets, I definitely would not be able to finish a whole slice by myself. We split one slice between 4 of us and it was just perfect. Lives up to the name for sure!\n\nThey also had their dessert bar upstairs that had their famous cookies. I have yet to open and try them, but definitely can't wait!\n\nReally great ramen and noodles and would highly recommend.",

      "After my last review, the management at Momofoku reached out to me following up, and for that, I give them five stars. I had previously written that I absolutely love the ramen here, specifically the chicken tan tan, but that the pork bun I had was not up to par. To make up for it, I was personally taken care of including reservations for me and two co-workers, and was given the opportunity to taste-test newer dishes that have yet to be released.\n\nI was given two dishes - Shredded apple with a sauce and Camembert, and a bok choy in a salty sauce with roe. The first surprisingly worked really well together, although there were both sweet and salt flavours, and the second dish was delicious and a perfect starter before my usual order of chicken tan tan. I do believe that I would order the bok choy were it to be on the menu.\n\nI cannot thank momofoku enough, as their customer service was a 5/5. The presentation was amazing and I felt like they truly went above and beyond to prove their brand and values.",

      "I really enjoyed my meal at Momofuku. The ramen was pretty good but not the best I've ever had. However, I thought the pork belly buns and milk bar ice cream were both top notch. We ordered the garlic ramen and the pork belly ramen. I actually wasn't the biggest fan of the type of ramen noodle used. It was a thin noodle which had a rather square shape. The noodle was also a bit firmer than I ideally like. I didn't dislike the noodle, it was just a bit different than my ideal noodle; I'm sure some people would love it though. The ramen broth for both bowls were good. The pork broth was less fatty than your standard tonkatsu ramen broth but a bit more salty. I like the spices they put into the pork broth to give the broth tiny bit of kick. The garlic broth was like a cross between a shoyu broth and a tonkatsu broth. The garlic and soy sauce flavors were definitely the base of the broth. The pork meat used were delicious and high quality. The egg is served soft boiled, almost raw in the broth. I liked the egg, but I think I would have preferred the traditional style of ramen egg boiled for slightly longer time.\n\nThe pork belly bun was one of the best I have ever had. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and there was probably double the amount of pork than most pork belly buns. The milk bar ice cream was simply delicious. We tried the cereal ice cream and the crack pie ice cream. The cereal ice cream is one of the most unique ice creams I have ever tried; yet it was also strangely very familiar because it actually tastes like a bowl of milk and cereal.",

We went for lunch earlier this week; I have the pork buns and pork ramen, my mother had the pumpkin ramen and my daughter had the ginger scallion noodles. The noodles were all cooked perfectly, with the right amount of tooth. The broth was delicate, but had complexity a depth, the poach egg was perfectly cooked, and the yoke (again) added more depth to the broth. My pork was cooked perfectly and the buns were addictive. Even my daughter (who is 1.5 years old) loved and ate everything she was offered. The staff were all very friendly and attentive without hovering and were great with my daughter too. Looking forward to trying more of David Chang's restaurants. \nMy only complaint would be that I wish they served warm green tea as an option too.",

Thanks David Chang for coming to Toronto!\n\nWhat's inspiring me to write this right now is a recent lunch. It was absolutely frigid outside and a nice bowl of ramen was just what the doctor ordered. I had a spicy ground chicken ramen bowl with bok choi, scallions and a perfectly poached egg. For me, the soup was singing my favourite song and it warmed me from the inside out. We also had some pickled vegetables to kick things off- not as thrilling, but crisp and fresh. \n\nThe atmosphere is casual. The chairs have no backs and service can be hit and miss depending on the rush. But pro tip: if it's too busy to get a table right away, just pop a squat in the lobby of the Shangri-La Hotel. If you're lucky, you'll be serenaded by piano.",

Gave four stars because it nice that u can grab a good quick meal without breaking the bank. Did i find the ramen mind blowing? No but i enjoyed. The pork buns were to die for. Service on the elementary side but i still would recommend. Ill stop by again my next time in Toronto. ",

      "I came here twice, once for a regular lunch and once for Winterlicious 2018 lunch ($23).\n\nFor Winterlicious, I would've given 3 stars, but I'm glad I went back recently to try again because the second time was definitely 5 stars!\n\nRegular lunch: \n- Ginger Scallion Noodles (added katsu for $4): amazing! The pickled vegetables were scrumptious and the noodles were savoury. Definitely would recommend including the katsu, it added protein and a crunch to the entire dish\n- Seven Spice Sour Slushie: if you love sour, this is the drink for you! Tasted both sweet and sour with the yuzu, and not overwhelmed by the sake. Would recommend getting the larger size (the smaller size just looked TOO small)  \n\nWinterlicious lunch:\n- Chili Chicken Bun: fried chicken was delicious, the perfect amount of crispiness\n- Pork Ramen: presentation looked great, the pork belly was delicious and melted in your mouth, but the rest of the ramen was nothing special, not that flavourful \n- Milk Bar Crack Pie: a bit sweet and bland at the same time, no particular flavour besides sugar \n\nService was a bit slow on both occassions because the restaurant is very busy at lunch time, I would definitely recommend making a reservation.\n\nOverall I would come back here for those Ginger Scallion Noodles!",

As you wait, you'll be treated to the free wifi of the hotel lol. Pork belly ramen's broth ($16) was really delicious. Not a huge serving but tasty and filling and worth the high price. Cookies ($3+) on the 2nd flr at Milk is so-so. I've tasted better cookies for sure. I also tried the vanilla cornflake sundae cone ($5+) by the cashier and it was alright . Nothing to be excited about. All in all, a good visit and will return again to try the other ramen flavors. ",

      "After an amazing noodle experience at Winterlicious 2017 I was worried Momofuku Noodle Bar wouldn't live up to the lofty expectations I had built up in my memory of it. \n\nHoly crap this place is so good. In my personal top 3 restaurants ever. The broth on the chicken ramen is creamy, spicy, tangy and something poets could scribe pages of verse about. The noodles are of such high quality that they are clearly homemade with love. The pork bun so soft but tangy, juicy and just SO flavourful. \n\nThe cereal milk dessert was a different beast with a strong corn flake flavour that wasn't unpleasant but the subtle vanilla makes it a nice counterpoint.\n\nOverall, if you like ramen or Asian cuisine. Believe the hype. This restaurant is stupendous and second to none while being head and shoulders above the rest.",

Be sure to make reservations ahead of time! We were able to share several dishes, including the black truffle ramen, fried chicken bao, roasted rice cakes, pepper noodles, and tuna sushi that was not on the menu. All of the dishes were very good, particularly the fried chicken bao and the black truffle ramen. The fried chicken bao was very crispy and tasty.  The black truffle ramen, although I couldn't taste the truffle very much, it was very enjoyable and flavourful.  Only issue is that it was way overpriced. The bowl of ramen was $32.\n\nOverall, the dishes were well-prepared, service was at a good pace and the server was very attentive and helpful in choosing the dishes.

      "3 stars? 3 STARS? I'm clutching my pearls. 3???? I must be a pleb because Momofuku Noodle Bar is definitely 5-star worthy excellence in my books. 5 stars to me doesn't necessarily mean perfection (but service and price have to be reasonably on point), however there needs to be some WOW factor. I need to keep thinking about the food there. Well, Momofuku didn't Momofukup in that department. \n\nI try not to review a place after only going once (unless I was able to sample a huge offering), so after going the first time and trying their Ginger Scallion Noodle, I really had to hold back. That was the best veggie dish I've ever had. I came back and got a taste of their bao and rice bowl and I think I'm ready to commit. UGHHH SO GOOD. I LOVE EVERYTHING. \n\n1) Ginger Scallion Noodle ($14 + $4 for Katsu) - Includes shitake mushrooms, pickles, pickled cabbage. Every different vegetable had a distinctly different flavour. My mind was blown. This wasn't some plain old noodle where all the veggies are similarly marinated. The Katsu was nice and crispy. The noodles were pleasingly chewy. I think this one's my favourite. \n\n2) Lamb Tsukemen ($18) - I learned that Momofuku's menu isn't stagnant when I came back wanting to order this, and it wasn't there! I had a bite of my friend's the first time I came. The dipping broth was Szechuan-inspired, red and numbing deliciousness. The lamb was super tender. \n\n3) Pork Belly Bao ($12) - You ever have pure decadence in your mouth? That comes in the form of melting pork belly, sweet hoisin sauce, soft Chinese bun, and a hint of pickle and scallions to cut through the fattiness when you think you can't take it anymore. \n\n4) Fried Chicken and Caviar Don ($20) - The fried chicken is different from the Katsu (not breadcrumb coated), but man that is some flavourful chicken!! The texture was crispy but the meat was moist. They use little trout caviar which offers a bit of resistance when you bite into them. Overall, it was an extremely interesting dish full of flavour explosions. I also had full-blown itis after it, so you know it's not a light lunch by any means. \n\nFor ramen, this place is definitely on the higher end, but for the financial district, the food's a steal. You could be spending $30 on pre-prepped food that tastes the same at all the overpriced chain restaurants in the area. Instead, you can spend that money on some incredibly tasty baos and noodles. Moxies...Momofuku...you be the judge.  \n\n(88/2017)",

      "David Chang's restaurant has been on my bucket list for nearly 3 years since I heard about him via the show Mind of a Chef. We have once traveled to NYC as poor newlyweds, and would not have eaten at any sort of restaurant like this back in the day. Flash forward to our wonderful spur of the moment trip to Toronto and what do we find: Momofuku Noodle Bar! Our first restaurant meal here (we had late night carry out, ballpark food and food center offerings at The Ex) and we are truly spoiled. We made a reservation but arrived early. I was surprised we could be seated early and was stunned to see that the ramen prices were reasonable and in line with prices we see in Chicago's Chinatown. It's near where we live. I ordered the shiitake bun and the corn ramen noodle bowl. My husband ordered the sockeye ramen dip. Everything was so wonderful. As was my cocktail, the Toronto--I'm a sucker for a good rye-based cocktail and this did not disappoint. My husband had room for dessert and so we were introduced to Milkbar by Laura our kind and gracious server. The only thing missing is a cold glass of milk: Whole, 2%, Nut-based, coconut-based---don't care, but get the milk as an option, please. I want to dunk my cookie now. :) We love you, Momofuku crew.Laura and another of the servers learned we were from out of town with our first visit to the city, let alone Momofuku. She helped us make sure our itinerary was good and complete, and even suggested some old churches here--we had planned to partake of Mass on Sunday at St. Michael's near our hotel. We may see Laura there. Thank you for hiring the best staff and providing the best service.",

      "Not the best ramen in town but holds its own amongst its competitors.  \n\nRestaurant was very energetic and lively and staff was very friendly. \n\n1) Pork Ramen\n- Soup was light compared to other ramen shops, I think its a seafood-based broth opposed to a chicken/pork broth.  A bit bland for my liking\n- Noodles were firm and had the \"bounce\"\n- Egg was very soft, Not a big fan\n- THE PORK BELLY THOUGH, this is why this place gets 4 stars (\" Yay! I'm a fan - Yelp, 2017\")  Each belly slice is a cm thick so it's very hearty contrasting the soup.  When you put it into your mouth, you actually forget you are eating pork belly because you achieve meat nirvana.  It just melts and disintegrates in your mouth as you try to chew it.  But you can't chew it because you already swallowed it and are about to take another bite.\n-The pork belly comes with a friend in the form of pulled pork shoulder, which is a nice alternative to the traditional sliced shoulder\n\n2) Pork Belly Bao\nSo after I had the ramen, I needed more belly in my belly so I ordered another signature, the pork bun.\n-Same reaction as above for the pork\n-Overall though, the sweetness of the bun itself and the hoisin sauce compliment the pork belly sauces better than the ramen.\n\nPlace is pricier than other ramen stores, but can't blame them since they are doing some weird mystic stuff to that pork belly of theirs. \n\nCame for the ramen, stayed (and coming later) for the belly",

      "This is my 6th time visiting Momofuku and the first time I'm writing a review.  I came to Momofuku Noodle Bar for lunch today. I made reservations ahead of time.  When I got here the lineup was long, glad I made reservations.  However if all your party haven't arrived they can't seat you.  Finally my friend showed up so we got seated on the second floor. The second floor wasn't available in the past. I'm glad they finally utilize this space to seat guests. It's more quiet on the second floor away from the kitchen. Very modern decor, I love it! We got seated and the service was great. I was worried that being on another floor the servers would never be around. Not the case at all. I ask for more water and hot sauce and our server was always there to help!  We ordered the pork belly bao and spicy rice cakes to start. So good. They were generous on the pork belly. Got 2 large slices in the soft bao.  The rice cakes was delicious.  Very flavourful, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. For my main dish I had the pork ramen.  More pork belly! Yum!  Soup was very flavourful and as great as I remembered it. My friend had the tuna ramen.  He commented that the noodle was like wonton soup noodle and it was ok.  His initial thought was to get the chicken Katsu rice bowl which the couple beside us ordered and it looked amazing. For the price $26 for the tuna ramen was not worth the price in my opinion but all in all it was a flavourful fish broth.  For dessert I got their specialty cereal milk ice cream. It essentially taste like the bottom of your bowl with the mushed up cereal and milk and they slathered it with cereal crumbs at the bottom and on top. My absolute favourite.  Such a great meal. It's pricier than other ramen place and smaller portions but it's still a great spot downtown in the financial district.  Will definitely be coming back!",

      "Downtown Toronto on Sunday? Early afternoon? Hungry like a wolf? Everything around looks closed! We had a brainstorm and headed to Momofuku noodle bar, which we've been to several times and which is a very reliable place to go for a tasty and quick bite at the best of times... even better when there's no other options!\n\nWe started with the pork buns, they're easy must-haves. To be honest, after settling on the pork buns, I sometimes have a hard time deciding what to order. I'm not a noodle junkie, and some of the more adventurous tasting bowls seem to always use ground meat, which I find a little boring. Buuuuuuuut, on this last visit, after scarfing back our must-have pork buns (we shared), we went a little off-model. I spotted the okonomiyaki burger on the menu, and my lunch-mate waffled on his order and decided to share that with me. We decided to pair the share with the fried cauliflower. Spoiler alert: Score!\n\nThe cauliflower was piping hot and really delicate, super yumsville. Very decadent. Like fries, but it's cauliflower. And please just consult the photo to learn about the burger. It was really all that. It was a knife and fork situation. Delicious take on okonomiyaki meets American style diner burger - as far as chopped iceberg lettuce and a Kraft slice. It all worked. (And even survived the dissection into two and transfer of half to another plate. \n\nI know people head to Momofuku for the standards (like the pork buns), but I'm always happiest with the surprises. See you next time!",

      "Momofuku is a great restaurant, I've come here many times now.\n\nI'm not a noodle or ramen fan, so I usually order other stuff from the menu. Most of the menu items are less than $20, which is really good value for the quality.\n\nI've tried almost everything on the menu (besides pork related items) and they are all enjoyable delicacies.\n\nMy favourite by far is the Japanese pancake burger - okonomiyaki. It's so unique to me, I absolutely love it.\n\nThe service is decent, the only down side is that this place is usually very busy. So expect to wait in long lines at times. In addition, seating is extremely crowded, and communal style. So, maybe you'll feel uncomfortable!",

It was cold and grey and the wind and snow were doing that thing where they work together to pelt your eyes with snowflakes so you look like you're crying. Hot, rich broth and some fresh veg with chewy noodles was exactly what I needed. \n\nMy group of three were all feeling the same way as it turned out. We showed up after lunch rush and sat and ordered within about five minutes. Under 10 mins later our meals arrived. One pumpkin ramen, one pork ramen, and one chicken tan tan. All arrived looking beautiful and we inhaled them promptly. I was full but I won't lie, I was ready for more about two hours later. Not because I was hungry again but just because I wanted more warming goodness after being forced to go outside again. Its soup season ladies and gents, and Momofuku has what you need.",

      "I find myself in a strange situation in doing a complete re-write of my review for Momofuku Noodle Bar. First, a bit of backstory.\n\nMy first review gave the place 3 stars and I had expressed a great dissatisfaction with the contrast between the quality of the food and the price being paid for it. I had concluded by saying that while the food is pretty good here, there are better and cheaper alternatives.\n\nAfter writing the review, I was invited to return again in order to spend some time speaking with one of the managers and to be offered a few items off the menu that are being developed for their updated menu which is likely now updated.\n\nTo start, I had a great time speaking with and getting to know the manager who invited me back. It is clear that he has a passion for his workplace and I truly appreciated his desire to invite me back and speak to their choices of ingredients and menu/food design. I developed a heightened appreciation for the team behind the restaurant itself.\n\nMy wife and I were then presented with a number of dishes to eat and enjoy a fine dinner on the house.\n\nHere is where I find myself conflicted. I cannot in good conscience improve my rating of the place because the food was actually worse than I had experienced in the past. This is not to say that the food is terrible here, it's just that the restaurant world is highly competitive and in order to receive rave reviews, the food should provide some kind of wow factor or at least be a solid and pleasing experience.\n\nOur meal began with a starter of Onigiri followed by an off-menu order of Okonomiyaki. Our server explained that the Okonomiyaki here was exactly like her favourite Okonomiyaki back in Japan where she was born. The Onigiri was actually pretty nice but we both found the Okonomiyaki to be far too mushy. Further, the sauces that topped the pancake bottom were an overwhelming mixture of salty, sour, and umami; ultimately masking whatever subtle flavour the rest of the dish had. We were informed that the dish included Kimchi but it was impossible to detect any kimchi at all...\n\nFinally, we shared their signature fried chicken with caviar Don. This place has become famous for their fried chicken and caviar which is surely an innovative combination, but not out of this world amazing. My wife and I both agreed that this dish was probably the best we had, but at its price point, the wow factor isn't there.\n\nWe debated if Momofuku's rating should go up and in the end, I simply cannot give it more than the original 3 that I gave it before. Food is competitive and you really need to know what the competition is doing to learn how to beat them.\n\nAfter we left and went for a walk, this experience lead me to come up with an idea for Restauranteurs. I believe that owners or head chefs should encourage their staff to always go and eat at other places that serve similar food in order to know if your products stand up against the competition or not. Also, by learning what others are doing, you will gain inspiration on how to go beyond the norms and offer a truly stand out meal to your customers!",

      "I lucked out with trying Toronto's location. Not only is it more grandiose and classy, but it was a lot larger; hence, no wait! (Compared to the 2-3 hour wait on the small streets of NYC). \n\nHis nikai on the second floor include Momofuku's various alcoholic creations. Why not try some to start the meal? Here we have  Smoke + Mirrors (tequila, spiced agave, chamomile, yuzu, bitters) and Shibuya Crossing (sake, tequila, vermouth, lemon juice, togarashi).  Both looking very similar and tasting similar too with the first drink tasting a lot stronger on the alcohol content. Even though these came in 2oz, they were enough to get me happy\n\nAnd it's always nice when a restaurant gives a complimentary starter: popcorn. It was topped with some kind of spicy and salty seasoning that gave it a nice little kick! (I was even daring to drizzle sirarcha on it afterwards).\n\nOkay, so people say Momofuku is known for his ramen and that's what the 3-hour wait in NYC was about, but I beg to differ. I think the real star of the show is the pork belly buns with hoisin, scallion and cucumber. They look plain and maybe a bit too simple, but never judge a book by its cover. These will fool you good because they are the most juiciest pork buns I can ever sink my teeth in. My taste buds were just loving the fatty juices that overflow my mouth. So intense in its porky flavor that I admit, I did come back the next day to order takeout while on a full stomach\n\nAnd finally, the \"star\" of the show is the pork ramen with belly, shoulder, fish cake and egg. Hmm, can I be honest? I am glad I didn't wait 3 hours in NYC to try this ramen. I mean, don't get me wrong: it's good!!!!! But not worth a 3-hour wait. The broth is very clear and thin yet tasteful. The shoulder added more salty to the dish, but it may be a bit too salty for me.. =\\ The noodles? Al dente and perfect! And what about that egg???? Ohhhhh, now we are talking about perfection!!!!!! Cooked so perfectly so that this egg is balancing on a very fine line between being undercooked to barely cooked enough to retain its softness and rawness. \n\nSo I admit, I am guilty to coming back here twice in a row. I came back to even order take out and enjoy the pork buns on the street. It was so good, I didn't care!!!! Nothing makes me happier than to chow down these pork buns while squatting on the streets in the dark because I don't know when the next time is gonna be. Again? Total worth\n\nPros:\n-very fast, classy, friendly service (attentive, detail oriented) \n-delicious out of this world pork buns \n-convenient located on second floor next to all his other restaurants \n-bakery on same floor\n-has a bar \n-clean restrooms\n-nice window scenary\n\n\nCons:\n-hard to find parking \n-can't think of anything",

The ice cream for dessert is interesting, but it is more of a novelty than being truly tasty, and really only needs to be tried once.

      "I really should have followed Drake's motto and \"started from the bottom\" of Momofuku, I think doing so helps you to manage your expectations as you ascend through it's many (an increasingly fancy) levels.\n\nAlas, my first visit to the Momofuku compound in the Shangri-La hotel was hitting up Daisho and one of the other upper floor restaurants. A night that was filled with high-quality fancy eats at high mark-up fancy prices. It was a special occasion so we didn't mind cutting some extra chedda for the meal but wowza... #Baller!\n\nIt wasn't until this week that I paid their more casual main floor noodle bar a visit. It's super chill, with most of the space being communal tables. The menu is not too big, with a few staple bowls of Ramen as well as some steamed Baos (buns) as starters. \n\nMinus points for not having a barrier between the outside cold and the first few rows of seats, it was frigid, AND to make matters worse the only thing warm to drink is the Ramen broth, no green tea, or coffee.\n\nAside from that, the Pork Ramen was pretty good, I'd say 3-ish stars, as in my mind it didn't really compare to Sansotei or Kinton Ramen the reining Ramen stars of the6.\n\nWhat really brought things to another level were their amazing steamed buns (Bao). Holy shit! I had the spicy chicken and it was basically an Asian-fusion version of a McDonald's McChicken sandwich but like fresh and delicious with a kick. The other was the pork belly Bao which came with a slab of pork belly double the size of steamed bun! The saltiness of the pork paired with the sweetness of the hoison sauce was amazing... I ate two!\n\nEatcrest out!",

      "I ordered the pork ramen noodle ($16) and the pork belly buns ($12). The order came with 2 buns, the meat was nice and thick. It's basically a steamed bun folded up with pork belly along with a generous amount of hoisin sauce. It was a great combination of flavours. It reminded me of peking duck. If you're a fan of that, you should definitely give this a try. \n\nThe ramen here is better than that at Sansotei, although pricier. It was a nice chewy consistency, the broth was amazing and I was happy with the thickness of the meat. \n\nThe only downside is that that I wish they had individual tables rather than a giant picnic type  they have where you can touch elbows with the strangers dining next to you. \n\nI also thought service could have been better although this was probably only because of our waiter. She didn't acknowledge me. She didn't look my way when asking if we were ready to order (we weren't, so she walked away) and it happened again when we asked questions about the menu and a final time when we actually ordered the food.

      "My first experience here wasn't amazing, but I had the chance to come back with a friend recently. We got to try a lot more of the menu, with recommendations from the wonderful general manager.\n\nWe had started with cute little slushies that were very refreshing for a hot day. We also got the kimchi jar and shrimp buns to start. The portions were seemingly small, but the kimchi jar was pretty densely packed and we surprisingly even had some left over by the end of the meal. The manager had recommended that we get the fluke, crab noodles, and rib. \n\nIf you love sashimi, the fluke will really wow you - it's raw but in a prosciutto kind of way. It was nice and smoked and when paired with the radishes was so yummy and refreshing. TBH we wanted to get two more of those dishes - one for the each of us .\n\nThe crab noodles are unfortunately seasonal. It is a dry noodle dish with a creamy coconut curry sauce and a deep fried soft shell crab on top - and it was so bomb! It was so good I didn't even wanna share it . \n\nThe rib was definitely the winner of the meal though. Holy it was actually huge and to my surprise, wasn't all bone. It had a ton of fatty juicy meat and it was great when paired with the tortillas. If you're looking for something to share, and is a great bang for your buck, I highly recommend this dish!",

      "I live in Los Angeles, but I've probably been to Momofuku Noodle Bar at least a half dozen times over the years, now in two different countries. I've had some great meals at the New York location, so I was happy to find there was one in Toronto when I was in town for a conference. I tend to eat sadly at these things--fast, utilitarian meals, often at lobby restaurants or chain sandwich shops--but apparently not in Toronto's Financial District. The Momofukuplex was a block from the conference hotel, and many of us attendees took advantage. I ended up going twice for lunch: first to Daishō, then to the Noodle Bar.\n\nI wasn't actively trying to do this--I wanted noodles, but was looking to check out Toronto's Chinatown while I was in the area. But when I linked up with my vegetarian friend Sarah W. for a late lunch, Momofuku stepped up as an easy option that was worth visiting from out of town. The place has a powerful draw, and its modern noodle shop concept means it accounts for vegetarians. I was happy to see reservations were accepted, and was able to book a table online an hour in advance, for 1:45 on a Friday afternoon. Not the most difficult time to get seated.\n\nThe place was still quite busy when we showed up, though there were a few seats available at the various long communal tables (all seating here is communal, I believe). The Noodle Bar was on the ground floor of the glass cube Momofuku building, and I'm guessing it does the most business. Service was friendly and efficient, and I had a tremendously satisfying meal.\n\nSince it had been a while since my last Noodle Bar visit, I went with classics all the way down: pork bun, pork ramen, and cereal milk soft serve. It was all excellent, the same level of in-your-face deliciousness I've come to expect from Momofuku. I've had many pork buns over the years since David Chang made them so popular, and still, none have come close to Momofuku's. These pillowy bao buns were stacked with drippingly unctuous pork belly and plenty of scallion and cucumber to cut through the fat. I asked for sriracha to pair with the hoisin sauce, and the buns were perfected. Given that I ate both by myself (Sarah got the shiitake buns and the potato dashi ramen, neatly parallel to my lunch), the pork ramen was probably overkill, coming with more of that decadent pork belly. It hit the spot, though, a hot bowl of soothing ramen on a brisk fall Toronto day, loaded with chewy noodles, pork belly, pork shoulder, fish cake, scallion, seaweed, and loose poached egg in a rich, silky broth. For dessert, I got the soft serve, the cereal milk swirled with fruity cereal milk, sprinkled with the corn flake crunch topping. Sweet and creamy, with a bit of salt and a crunch. A truly ideal dessert.\n\nIn keeping with Momofuku tradition, this Noodle Bar has a 3-star Yelp rating it in no way deserves. You all are welcome to manage your expectations, but the food here is ultra tasty. It's a great stop for a quick, casual lunch, and I'd come unhealthily often if I lived or worked in the area.",

So thick and creamy! Leaves you very satisfied. \n\nWaiter was really nice. Gave us a crash course on how to make ramen noodles! Trick is not to let it over cook by taking the noodles out and putting it in ice water immediately.",

      "My First Ramen Experience: \n\nOne of my good friends was vising from out of town and being the Foodie in our friend group, I had to impress with a good eating experience.  \n\nI had eaten at Daisho and the food was pretty good so I decided to give the Noodle Bar a shot. I had made reservations for a Wednesday and the bar was bustling. We were seated along the bar overlooking university ave. We ordered the Pork Belly Buns and Chili Chicken Buns to start. \n\nI really liked the Chili Chicken Buns; the bun was very soft and the chicken had a nice crisp to it. The Pork Belly Buns were a bit too fatty for me, but the flavor was good. \n\nOur Ramen was okay; I ordered the Pork Ramen and my friend ordered the Potato Dashi Ramen. She really liked hers; sour cream, jalapeno yam and watercress. There was nothing special about the Ramen. I wish I had ordered the Pepper Noodle with Beef Sausage or the Ginger Scallion Noodles. \n\nAlso if you have a fish allergy I would stay away, even though I had mentioned mine and all fish products were removed, I still had a slight reaction (probably cross contamination). \n\nKeep Eating, \n\nAngela",

      "Our first experience here was terrible, but the manager was very kind to email us to visit a second time. Our second experience was significantly better. \n\nIn short: Service this time was great because they were expecting us, although on a normal day the service can be hit-or-miss. The dishes are very creative, albeit not always tasty. It's definitely an interesting place to try if you're in the city, however, the price-to-quality ratio is a bit skewed if you're paying for your own meal.\n\nThe inari was interesting, but we weren't too fond of the taste. I'm a BIG fan of inarizushi in general. I found the stir fried rice to be a bit too soggy, and the flavours of the scallions and other elements didn't really work with the sweet inari wrap, IMO. The roe was a nice addition though. The inari are $6 for a single piece on the menu.\n\nThe cheeseburger okonomiyaki was... very bizarre. The kraft single was just awful inside the okonomiyaki. We make okonomiyaki at home, and I can imagine many other modern twists you can do to okonomiyaki that do not involve a cheeseburger. This dish is $14 on the menu. \n\nThe fried cauliflower was nice and simple. No way to mess this up. We enjoyed this a lot, but we would not get this normally because of the price ($10). The smoked salmon was nice and fresh; very simple. It was the nicest part of our meal, but we did not see it on the regular noodle bar menu.",

But while in Toronto I decided to go ahead and try this place out to see what's the buzz. \nI went in the evening and I will say that they need a bit more lighting inside the restaurant. It was just a tad bit dark for me. \nI ordered the pork ramen and the chicken Yuzu and I asked to send the chicken back. To me it has no flavor. I requested another bowl or pork ramen this was an excellent choice indeed. The pork ramen comes with  belly, fish cake, scallion, and egg. The pork bowl had so much flavor ! It was amazing I even took my left overs and had it the next evening for dinner. I also ordered the famous buns. The BBq pork bun -korean bbq sauce, slaw, sweet pickle (pork belly) and the chicken nugget -yuzu mayo, smoked pickle, iceberg. The both buns were great choices. If I happen to go back to Toronto I would be visiting this location to have the garlic pork noodles again. \n\nThey also have upstairs a mini milk bar fridge that you can walk in side and pick your dessert.",

There's a ramen shop in Chinatown nearby that's much better. The noodles were hard for my taste and the broth wasn't all that wow-y. The egg also was a bit too raw for me... Orenchi has spoiled me with their perfect ramen eggs... \n\nAnyways, the pork bun is awesome. I would just get two orders of this next time.

      "ok, we didn't get terribly creative. We we're on our way to Bat out of Hell, for the musical matinee. We simply wanted a good ramen experience. If you're not happy here - you might as well go back to Japan (and, incidentally, Ramen isn't first and foremost Japanese). This is an upscale dining spot. It doesn't pretend to be 'middle of the road' Ramen. The ramen isn't made on site - it's custom made in Toronto - I can live with that. Udon noodles are a Japanese art form. Ramen noodles are not! But I make alkaline noodles and these are great. Toothy. Yellow... flavorful. Made on Site? No. Custome made? Yes.So, we both had pork belly Ramen. A little mild, but not a problem with a good sriracha chili on the table. The onsen egg was perfect. The noodles were perfectly cooked. The dahsu was very flavorful. Ok, we also had the pulled pork buns. BRILLIANT! a nice terrine of pulled pork. Cut like a slice of pork belly... but different. The sriracha mayo coupled with a great steamed bun was delicious. I ate the entire noodle fair offered, plus the pork bun. It was GREAT. Ok, if you know what Lucky Peach is, the second floor has a chilled desert/book room that has not only Lucky Peach magazines, but also David Chang's books. Ok, I went expecting David Change quality food and I was not disappointed! You decide. Personally, I'd go with your gut--- ie dine in and decide for yourself!",

      "Momofuku Noodle Bar intrigued us and it was only about a ten minute walk from our hotel and we had to have something Japanese in the area and this was our choice for lunch.  We arrived at Momofuku after a short walk and were greeted as we entered.  They asked if we had a reservation, we did not, and they seated us immediately.\n\nThe young lady then gave us the day's menu and took our drink order.  When she returned with our drinks, we placed our food order: Pork Ramen for my wife and Pork Buns (could be my nickname) for me.\n\nThey have several seating arrangements from individual facing the outside or the chef area, to smaller tables possibly for reservations, and longer community style tables for those with no reservations like us.  Soon we were talking with new friends who were seated at our table shortly after us.\n\nThen the food arrived!  I had not had this type of Pork Bun before so I was curious how it would taste.  It had a couple of very thin slices of cucumber and Hoisin Sauce and two thick slices of grilled pork belly.  It had great flavor but was a bit messy to eat...no points off for messy, ever, just saying.  The order was for two Buns.\n\nThen the Pork Ramen was delivered to our table and the appearance seem unauthentic (using a poached egg instead of soft boiled) although I believe this restaurant is more fusion and new things than traditional.  The taste was good but we were looking more for authentic Japanese.  Overall it was a good experience and the staff were especially attentive and friendly.",

The broth is the selling point for the ramen, which it should be and the TanTan Ramen hits the spot. Again, the broth is where it's at. However, the best thing by far at Momofuku are the Roasted Rice Cakes. I could eat them all day, every day. They are like nothing I've had before: chewy, a tad spicy and delicious.

      "This is probably the most 'bougie' ramen place I ever been to and that's probably because it is  inside a hotel. They have coat hanger outside, they take reservations, they have a small popsicle stand (milk), they even have a prix fixed meal option. \n\nMy friend and I decided to not go with the prix fixed dinner and ordered off the regular menu (which you would have to ask for) . We both get the pork ramen and an order of the pork buns. The pork buns were a little disappointing. I definitely had a lot better elsewhere. The bun were super soggy and wet (which is understandable since they are steamed but these were a little more moist than most places) and the pork itself was kind of bland. \n\nAs for the pork ramen, it was good/okay, on a scale of 1-5, I would say 3.5 at the most. The broth good, the ramen was cooked nicely. Loved that they included fish cake.  Portion was good and I wasn't even able to finish my bowl. \n\nTLDR; Great service, environment is very upscale but overall a very casual place.

      "Went to this place the other week. I'm not a huge ramen snob but I do like when the broth is super flavourful and rich. And I enjoy when the toppings are bigger in size. I ordered the tan tan ramen. The toppings on in the bowl wasn't enough. Specifically the pork. It was one and a half pieces of pork. The broth was great though. Kind of spicy and had a nice kick to it. Thicker broth than other ramens I've had. I also ordered the cran-blossom slushie in the small size. It was very small but tasted very good, I would go for the larger size next time. \n\nThe place is open concept where everyone sits together on benches. I enjoyed this aspect as this is something you don't see often here in the western world. \n\nThe one thing that made our experience odd is the waitress. She didn't say much and seemed like she was angry or something. This was one of those times where you are reminded of how important the service is when you go to a new place to try something exciting. The waitress just kind of stopped the exciting factor for us. \n\nI would try this place again if I was in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way.",

      "A group of us decided we wanted to try their large format fried chicken meal earlier in the day, and then showed up in the evening. We asked if we could get the large format, and the waitress informed us that they require 24 hours advanced notice for the meal, but will check with the kitchen. I don't remember seeing this requirement on their website, but was not going to be too disappointed if things didn't work out because there were still the bao's to try. However, she returned and told us that they just happened to have a set available because a party had cancelled their order, so we could take it. And so we did.\n\nBefore the chicken came, some equipment was brought to the table: a large bowl for the bones; two smaller bowls; two tongs to grab the chicken; 8 scallion pancakes; a small bowl of ginger scallion sauce; a small bowl of jalapeno garlic sauce; a jar of pickled vegetables; a basket of lettuce, herbs, and radishes; and tabasco salt.\n\nWe finished the jar of pickled vegetables rather quickly as there wasn't much, and was wondering if they were complimentary. We asked a waiter passing by, and he said he had to check with the kitchen. Nope, apparently each jar was $6. Guess that was it for pickled vegetables. Fortunately, they were OK with providing extra lettuce.\n\nThe chicken came within 15 minutes, and it was a pretty large plate for 4 to 8 people........ I guess? Maybe if you're with a party of light-eaters, where a thigh and a drumstick is enough to fill you up.\n\nIt comes as advertised: a bunch of southern fried chicken and a bunch of korean fried chicken. You're looking at roughly 12 pieces of each, but that number includes small wings/drumsticks. There are probably only 6 large pieces of each flavor. On average, between the four of us, we only had about 4-5 pieces each, plus some of those small pieces.\n\nThe southern fried chicken was juicy, skin was crispy, and the flavor was great. The korean friend chicken was not too spicy, not too sweet. Mixed with the sauces, the lettuce, or the scallion panackes, it provides a great dining experience.\n\nHowever, this is $125 for fried chicken. I am not a fried chicken connoisseur, and was unable to tell the difference between the Popeyes fried chicken straight out of the fryer I had last week, and this momofuku fried chicken. For perspective, you can get 16 pieces of chicken at popeyes for $30, and I'm pretty conflicted. Same for korean fried chicken: there are so many korean fried chicken places uptown and in koreatown on bloor that offer you just as much chicken for $30.\n\nGranted, the dining experience you get at the places I mentioned above, are very different from how momofuku presents themselves. It's a clean restaurant with interesting decor, all the way to the washrooms and the elevator, and there are plenty of other options to choose from the menu on top of the chicken. Your waiter checks up on you and offers water refills, which you definitely won't find at popeyes.\n\nBut realistically, unless you have business clients over or you're taking your date out for some fried chicken and need somewhere nice, I'd just stop by a place that specializes in fried chicken. Bring your own lettuce, dips, and/or scallion pancakes.",

      'Knowing that I am a heavy ramen addict and I typically get my ramen fix in Japan Town San Francisco, I would have to say I was quite impressed with this restaurant.I love the ambiance. Your waiter takes you to either the lower or upper floor and you are seated on either a group bench or barrel. There is a bar at all the way to the back of the restaurant, where you can order food as well but this is not a full size bar and does not have many beer or wine choices.I was disappointed by my own decision for not getting the Momofuku Ramen w/ pork belly and pork shoulder, which is their signature. Instead, I opted for the Black truffle ramen because who doesn\'t love a little truffle in their life? Even though I would recommend this dish, don\'t count on it getting you full BUT boy did it pack some flavor. Should you be daring and get the truffle dish, keep in mind it does not have a broth or soup but dipping sauce.On the top floor, they also have a "Milk Bar" upstairs where you can by amazing sweets, like cookies and powdered milk to go.Picked up the blueberry and famous "compost cookie" on my way out and I have to say, I have no regrets.Highly recommend if you are looking for some flavorful ramen in the Toronto area. Great for groups as well!',

      "As a diehard fan of the Momofuku and Lucky Peach brand it was a no-brainer that after moving to Toronto I needed to visit Momofuku Noodle Bar. To my surprise they had a Summerlicious lunch special which offered 3 different items for $18. I chose the Chicken Tantan Ramen, BBQ Pork Bun and the Cereal Milk Soft Serve.\n\nAll 3 items were delicious, especially the ramen and the soft serve. Considering how much hype there is for this place and the long lines I appreciate that they kept their prices fairly reasonable.\n\nMy only complaint? I thought the upstairs Milk Bar area was going to be a small restaurant/cafe but it was really just a small storage locker filled with prepackaged Milk Bar products.\n\nI would recommend coming here during their off hours but I have a feeling that they're packed the entire time they're open. Be prepared to try a couple times to get a server's attention.",

      "I came to Momofuku Noodle Bar for lunch after hearing about it a few days ago. I arrived close to the end of the lunch rush, but it was still quite busy and I had to wait 15 minutes for a table for 1. I suggest making a reservation if you don't want to wait.\n\nThe menu was short, which made ordering quite easy. As much as I wanted to try the traditional pork ramen, I'm not a fan of pork belly. Therefore, I decided to try the chicken ramen. The food arrived very quickly and service was great at the beginning, but more about that later.\n\nThe ramen broth was pretty spicy, but it subsided over time. The broth had a hearty flavor, which I enjoyed. What I liked the most was the egg. It was so smooth and perfect. The chicken also had a hearty flavor. The chicken definitely tasted like they were marinating in something, since the flavor reminded me a lot of a Thai curry. The noodles were perfectly chewy.\n\nI was seated on the 2nd floor and when it came time for the bill, there were no servers around. They were all on the 1st floor. Eventually, I just walked downstairs and paid the hostess.\n\nThe food was a solid 4, service was a 3.",

Maybe I had too many expectations for this place... the place looks really nice, I like that you can see the kitchen and everyone working. We ordered the buns and a bowl of ramen each. The pork bun was really good indeed. For the ramen, I found the broth way too salty.

That last one was the best dish - a perfect game of taste and temperatures.We were so full we skipped desert.Service was the real issue. We felt forgotten.

      "I have mixed feelings about Momofuku Noodle Bar. I have made a few trips here before and been overall unimpressed. The ramen/noodle dishes were bland and overpriced and I found the benches on the main floor to be really uncomfortable. The service is curt and short. However, I came here with my husband's family for a celebratory dinner and it was really special. \n\nThe evening started with some cocktails and pork buns. I ordered the Impeachment ($14), which was utterly delicious. I don't like overly strong or sweet cocktails, and this was well balanced and quite sour. The pork belly buns is one of the best items on the menu. I would come here just to eat a few orders of these babies. The fried chicken dinner ($125) comes with a variety of accompaniments, including pickled vegetables, onion pancakes, sauces and lettuce (not that I ate any lettuce). The fried chicken is done two ways - a spicy Korean version and an American version. It was a decadent, messy and delicious dinner. I'm a huge fan of eating the chicken with the pancakes and accompaniments. \n\nThe perfect, sweet ending to the evening was the Milk Bar birthday cake, which is apparently flown in from the bakery in New York. I was expecting the cake to be one of those that looks good, but doesn't taste great, but I was really wrong. The cake was still quite fresh and the icing wasn't too sweet. \n\nThe only downside to the evening was the service. It was slow, and too fast at the wrong times.",

We ordered the ramen and it was below average if anything. I've had much much better at most places. The bao buns were the highlight of our dinner and were delicious. After our meal we wanted dessert, with no server in sight we went off to find the ice cream, we went into the cold fridge which was nearly empty at 8pm on a Saturday night, so we grabbed a cookie and headed downstairs to get some ice cream. The server at the ice cream station was very confused and more concerned with finding our server to add it to our bill rather than service (ya ..we were all looking for servers) once found she poured our ice cream. The cereal milk ice cream was sensational! A good ending to a kufufflae of an experience. I'd go back to grab ice cream at $6 a cone but overall I'd say it's overrated.",

      "Celebrated a birthday here, was very interested to try as I have heard many good things from friends. I ended up sharing shrimp buns (AMAZING) and ordered the garlic ramen off a recommendation from the waitress. I asked if the pork shoulder could be left out (simply because I knew I wouldn't eat) but she indicated that substitutions (or exclusions in this case) tend to be met with flack. Overall, the ramen was good but not amazing. The highlight for me was the milk bar! The birthday cake truffles are a sweet, fun dessert (think cake pops) and the crack pie was a nice treat to take home! Layout is not my favourite as it does get quite crowded and loud, and can be difficult for intimate conversations.",

When my ramen came out, my friend could not even handle the smell which I understand but I was used to it because of the curry and the bamboo. However, the taste of the ramen was definitely disappointing. There was an average amount of chicken but I couldn't really tell if it was marinated in something (like other reviews have said) and I tasted something crispy too. The noodles weren't as chewy as I have liked and the ramen itself was mediocre and I had better. The service was good, space is beautiful, but meh they may be able to improve a lot on their ramen.",

      "One last meal with the cous (and her co-workers) meant we were eating lunch downtown somewhere. That somewhere turned out to be the infamous Momofuku Noodle Bar, which I've actually never been to before. The David Chang empire finally made it's way to Canada so I guess you can only avoid it for so long. \n\nIf you've never been before, it's inside the Shangri-La hotel. The inside is modern and upscale with several long communal sharing tables. Upstairs houses the rest of the Momofuku empire (Shoto, Daishō, Nikai and Milk Bar).\n\nI'm not sure why but they don't let your party sit until everyone's there. Seems unnecessary when there were vacant tables...\n\nThe menu is broken into snacks, buns, noodles and etc. But don't forget about the truffle rice cakes ($45.00) and cavier & fried chicken ($150.00)! WTF.\n\n- Pork buns ($10.00) - this is what D. Chang is famous for. Tasty and flavourful but $10.00 for two buns is absolute cray.\n\n- Okonomiyaki ($7.00) - as our appetizer, it hit the spot.\n\n- Pork ramen ($16.00) - the broth was decent but nothing special. I felt the same way about the noodles; passable but indifferent. Both slices of pork were good; very tender along with a well executed egg. Overall, their ramen bowls need work.\n\n- Chicken tan tan ramen ($14.00) - the cous got the chicken tan tan and the broth had a decent kick to it from what I tasted.\n\nBranches are never as good as the OG so keep that in mind if you come to Momofuku. Everything we had was decent but it's a tad overrated and overpriced. Personally, I would seek out the more authentic ramen spots.",

      "Though i have been going to this restaurant since it opened doors here in TO, this will be the only time I am writing my review. Of all the Ramen house in TO this is my No. 1. I usually order the Pork Ramen Noodles (with broth). This is not for health conscious people but my God, the pork melts in your mouth. I love the mix, i can taste a Kimchi hint but not sure. I complained once about the noodles not that scorching hot, i was told thats the their ramen has the standard temp for serving after that I become accustomed to it. You shoud try the Buns!!! Our favorite is the Pork bun, i like the how the soft textured bun goes with the very soft pork belly - this is Heaven. For this visit I was with a friend, she ordered the No broth - Ginger Scallion Noodle with Chicken. She liked it same as the Pork Ramen the noodles were cooked Aldente. She also ordered the Pork BBQ bun but she commented that the Original Pork bun is better.. When you eat the bun dont forget to put some sriracha sauce. Dinner will be so busy - afternoon before 5pm is usually off peak.Observation - serving is now smaller compared to when it first open obvious from the bowl that they use to serve the noodles. Note: Dont forget to visit the cookie bar at the second floor.",

      "This is perhaps the grandest, fanciest Asian noodle joint in all the world with it’s intriguingly ornate sculpture outside and magnificently airy wooden interior. But give me a steaming 3-seat yatai in Sapporo’s ramen yoko-cho anyday. I would go so far as to say I would prefer a bowl of Sapporo Ichiban instant noodles to the $16 pork “ramen” they serve here.Bottom line: Momofuku serves absurdly expensive and complicated versions of what should be simple, comforting street vendor food. Unlike most authentic Asian noodle restaurants of whatever variety, the portions here are small. You’re paying for ambiance and for the privilege of eating simple working class food complicated to the point where it is not actually delicious and does not actually resemble what it purports to be. Even something simple like iced tea is disappointing here. For $5 you’d expect an “iced green tea” to be a tall frosty glass of emerald green matcha. Nope. You get a small glass of sweetened brown sencha. If you want ramen go to a real ramen restaurant where the ramen tastes like ramen and the tea is free. Momofuku looks magnificent, but this emperor most definitely has no clothes.",

Because we did not want a large meal before the performance she chose to go to the Momofuku Noodle Bar at the Shangri-La Hotel. Each dish was an amazing awakening of our senses. Our palate was teased with soft puffy Shrimp buns filled with spicy mayo, pickled red onion, iceberg, and the BBQ Pork Belly Ssäm in lettuce cups filled with kimchi, and finally we downed some divine Mayan Prawns, served with carrot, orange and Sichuan peppercorn, before we dashed off down the street to listen to give our ears their own orchestral joy.

      "Really excited to come here after all the buzz about the milk bar. We got seated immediately but keep in mind your entire party needs to be there in order to be seated. The restaurant is also kind of cramped--you share tables with other other parties so it's kind of like a (noodle) bar organized restaurant. \n\nI have to say, the food was unappetizing, except for the rice cakes (but it was overpriced at three spoonfuls for $11). The ginger scallion noodles and the potato dashi ramen had no taste and the pork ramen's broth and the extremely spicy noodles were way over seasoned, especially the latter. We asked the waiter for hot water but they did not have any so she offered extra pork broth as an alternative. That, however, did not help because the broth was sodium in a bowl. Moreover, we were charged for the broth even though it was offered as an alternative for water. \n\nThe menu was also very confusing. I added Katsu to my noodles, which was $4 extra, but they don't specify which meat it is. I assumed it was going to be pork, since \"Katsudon\" is fried pork cutlet over rice, but instead it was chicken, which I do not eat. \n\nThe food was served quickly but we got some nasty attitude from the server. In addition, they were very peculiar about getting every cent out of their visitors. Do not recommend and will not be coming back here.\n\nUPDATE: manager reached out to me and I really appreciated their customer service. Excited to try out other things from momofuku the next time.",

I thought they were decent. Maybe it's just me but I found them really messy to eat. I found myself using lots of napkins. \n\nI ordered the Tantan Ramen ($15), which was a chicken base. I didn't think it was spectacular but it wasn't horrible either. I'm not the biggest fan of ramen to begin with so it takes a lot to get me excited. As always, I wanted more chicken. In general I didn't think it was worth the $15 since I can barely remember what it tasted like. \n\nMy husband ordered the Pork Ramen ($16). He said his was pretty good and that the broth was flavourful. Not memorable or one of the best ones, but fine for the price. \n\nService: At times our server disappeared and we had to flag her down. It was fairly busy and we had to wait for our food for a little bit longer than we thought. \n\nOverall experience: Good. It's cafeteria style so you may have strangers beside you so be aware of that. As well, there are blocks of wood for chairs. There is also no place to put your bag because the spaces are pretty small. We didn't have a wait because we came fairly early but there were people waiting as we left. You can also go upstairs to get Momofuku Milk Products to take home. They can add it to your bill or you can pay separately. \n\nIn general we probably won't be back. There are better ramen places out there.",

      "We tried Momofuku desert bar in New York, so we were looking forward to trying out their ramen here back in Toronto. Great location. Service was prompt and friendly. Too bad it stopped there. Upon entering, we were immediately struck by the noise and cramped seating. Reminds one of the lunch halls that suffocate the air with everyone's voices. Good thing service was fast. Well, at least we have the food to look forward to. We ordered pork ramen ($16) and potato soup ($14). Probably less than 10 minutes, the waiter came to serve our food. Living in Japan's Hakata area where the tonkotsu ramen was born, we were excited to try what this shop had created... The smell of the potato soup was good. The soup was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The noodles were perfectly boiled to my preference. The rest of the ingredients were okay but the bad part was how the Japanese yam was undercooked. I asked the waiter if that was the way they did it and they said that the idea is to keep the potato firm. Firm I get but this was not firm. You could hear the crunching of the potato as you bit into it. You get the picture.The pork ramen was not tonkotsu. It was clear broth. A bit tasty but falls flat. I guess if you want a clear noodle soup then perhaps this would do. But even the meat failed to impress. When paying, note that tip is already included. The waiter should inform that their machine has not been corrected and still asks for more tips.At the end of the day, it comes to the taste and price. Was the watery pork ramen worth $16? Was the undercooked yam soup worth $14? We don't think so. We've tried better and this is not the exquisite Japanese ramen I'm used to, not even close to the less rich ramen of Hokkaido. ",

Despite confirming with the restaurant the time of our reservation, we were still made to wait over 15 minutes for our table. When we ordered our meals at about 6:30, the restaurant was already completely out of one of the dessert choices, on the very first day of Winterlicious. Nor did they offer an alternative for this dessert choice. Noodle bowls were the only choices for entrees. Meals arrived at different times, and the service was not up to the usual Momofuku standards. All in all, it was a disappointing meal (and by the way, the bill for food and drinks for 4 adults and one child was $250.00). If you want a great Winterlicious meal, try one of the O & B restaurants instead. They really know how to do Winterlicious!!",

      "Wanted to go out for a special occasion, but still wanted a casual dining experience. Unfortunately, I listened to the hype more than the reviews on here. \n\nI respect David Chang as a chef, however there's definitely a lack of direction or overview here. The food was very underwhelming. I've had the same kind of dishes at other (significantly cheaper) places and had a much better experience.  As far as I'm concerned, there was nothing new or exciting about the dishes, so I'm not sure what warrants the premium prices? It's the Momofuku brand.\n\nI'm giving it a 3 as the food was still edible and mostly tasted pretty good.  We had 2 ramens and some buns. I found the food to be over salted, and the ramen had a one-dimensional taste.\n\nMomofuku, you can be so much better! Don't rest on your laurels.",

      "I had been waiting to come to Momofuku for quite some time, and a quick business trip to Toronto allowed me this experience. Unfortunately it was not the one I expected. I ordered 2 varieties of the Bao Buns and the chicken ramen bowl for a cost (including delivery charge) of $50. Upon the arrival of my food I noticed the bag was soaked, which told me the broth had leaked, and when I asked the delivery guy what happened he just shrugged his shoulders and left. About 1/2 the broth leaked out of the container. The bao buns barely had any filling and were overly salted. There were almost no toppings/pickles and were incredibly small. For $10 each I was not impressed. The ramen left much to desire from the overly chewy ramen noodles, over cooked egg yolk, and bland flavouring, I was thoroughly disappointed. HOWEVER, I did email the management about my experience and they were wonderful. They offered me a full refund and assured me that this is not the quality of food or service the restaurant provides and assured me they would speak with the staff and delivery service they use. They offered to have me back at the restaurant the next time I'm in Toronto for a (hopefully) better experience.",

      "Fusion ramen restaurant. \nI personally didn't find their food \"wow\". Ramen portion was small, soup wasn't hot, and ramen itself was kina soggy. The tsukemen soup was only warm. Not too impressed with the quality and price. However, in my lamb tsukemen; the lamb was really tender and juicy. Aside the lamb... I think other stuff was a-ok meh to me. \n\nThere is fried chicken platter which we saw people/family ordering.. but it was a big portion and I think it was over $100. We didn't get that. \n\nThe milk bar basically is cereal with milk soft serve. I wouldn't mind it, but again for pricing.. I think I wouldn't purposely come here for their dessert or picking up cookies. \nThey have a milk bar fridge upstairs on the 2nd floor where customers can freely go up, pick their cookies and stuff then pay for it on the main floor cashier just before you go out the door. \n\nI don't crave it and I don't recommend it.

      "I had the pork belly ramen here, being a pork belly lover, I was enthused to see the large pork belly portions in my ramen. They're not your usual thinly cut pieces of pork belly that are served at traditional ramen places. However, the excitement ended after the first few bites & sips of the broth. When you have very fatty components to a dish, it's important to have a flavourful broth and ingredients that balance out the fatty components. I like to think of the fat as a vehicle to deliver and enhance flavours. My critique is not that it is too fatty, but the other components of ramen failed to come together to deliver a flavourful experience. The broth was bland- there wasn't any other bold flavours to compliment the fattiness of the pork belly. The egg wasn't cooked like a traditional ramen egg, it was runny, which also contributes to the watered down flavours.   Even the pork belly itself, I felt could've had better seasoning. \nI appreciate that Momofuku tried to take on a different approach with ramen, however it failed in execution. There are other places in the city that serve much better ramen with bigger portions at a cheaper price point.",

      'The restaurant is supposed to open at 11:30 am. We waited with another 10 people in a tiny waiting room till the hostess finally opened the doors almost 15 minutes late.The restaurant has aproximetaly 70 seats. About 20 are counter seats and the rest at communal tables seating 6 to 12 people on wooden blocks or long benches. No seat has a back.The place is VERY noisy. The hostess decides where you seat and her goal seemed to fill table and not to accommodate customers\' requests or seating preferences. Ours were flatly refused.The service from beginning to end was hurried, impersonal and inattentive.The menu items allow to serve meals very quickly based mostly on pre-prepared items with little need for cooking to order. From the time we were seated until we left it was about 30 minutes. This was similar to the time it took the 10 other people who were seated when we were. Appetizers and mains were served together very shortly after we ordered.The food was very disappointing. The buns (2 very small items with the bun acting like a "soft taco") were $10 for the Shitake mushroom which had a commercial tasting, overpowering sauce and 3 others buns on the menu sell for $12. The BBQ pork bun was tasty.The mains are Ramen noodles with broth ($14-16), and noodles without broth (14-18).I had the Ginger Scallion Noodles. A small bowl, very greasy and uninspiring.For a glorified quick service, impersonal restaurant the prices are very high especially considering the portion size, quality and prices of the raw ingredients served.For a downtown full of great food choices, going there was a decision that we greatly regret.',

I was not prepared for what was a poor showing all the way through:1. the noodles tasted like they were instant, too thick and not al dente2. The sauce mix was ordinary black sauce, no fragrance saved for the fresh scallions liberally thrown on top3. The noodles were lukewarm to start with and got cold quickly4. Shockingly, they don't serve ANY hot beverages on site. Nothing is worse than trying to wash down lukewarm noodles with a cold soda. Won't recommend this to anyone.

      "I came here a while ago on a cold winter night with no expectations at all, just wanted something warm and soupy. We had to wait a little bit although it was almost closing time. We got seated at the bar area against the wall so it was kind of squishy, and the restaurant is actually really cold indoors, especially when customers were opening and closing the doors fml. I really wanted to try the cereal milk soft serve but they didn't have anymore :( Worth trying once but I'd much rather go to Sansotei or Kinton.\n\nPork Ramen ($16) - The broth was yummy and flavourful, but it didn't make my top 5. Something about this bowl of ramen made it kind of meh.\n\nTan Tan Ramen ($15) - It was nothing special, couldn't really remember how it tasted like haha.",

      "Probably the worst ramen I've ever had so far in Toronto. It may seem like I'm over-exaggerating, but I'm truly not. The eggs were not cooked properly, the broth had barely any flavor and the meat was not tender (too thick). This is just the pork ramen. The potato dashi ramen (or whatever it's called) is an embarrassment to all bowls of ramen in the world. The potato ramen literally tasted like I was eating a chip broth with bitter water\n crests.\n\nAdditionally the manager insulted my taste buds for saying their ramen was not tasty and had the AUDACITY to ask me to come back.\n\n10/10 would NOT recommend.",

It was the smallest portion of soft serve and there was no reason for the corn flakes to be charged.  Corn flakes are worth nothing! As interesting as the flavour was, the ice cream was not that great.  Definitely will not come back for the desserts, but I am still curious about the ramen and baos.",

We ordered ramen noodles with pork and skirt steak for main course. The ramen noodles were pretty good, mostly because the pork was tender and juicy. The skirt steak was just ok. Nothing special. \n\nThe ice cream was mediocre too. Not worth the $2.75. \n\nMore than anything, the service was sloooow. I had to ask for someone to come take our drink order.

      "So I never post about restaurants online but I'm feeling it's necessary to report the experience I had today (June 16, 2017). I had been meaning to stop by the Milk Bar one of these days to try some of the cereal milk ice cream, and today's 30+degree weather prompted me to go for it. I headed over after work to grab some, and was looking forward to unwinding in the air conditioning with my treat for a few minutes after a long day.I sat down at one of the tables by the window, just long enough to snap a pic of my ice cream and take two bites. After that a gentleman who works at the restaurant came over to inform me that they were closing the dining room between 4 and 5. The guy then stands there hovering over me as if to imply I should pack up my things to get out of there right away. I looked at my phone and it was 3:59. I was then essentially urged out the door onto the street. This was appalling customer service. I'm just wondering why this man couldn't have given me five minutes to eat my two ounce cup of ice cream I just paid for? Have you been trained to rush customers out of your restaurant so that your schedule can be accommodated, buddy? As someone with restaurant experience I usually let a lot slide when it comes to mistakes and mix ups, but this was appalling and ruined my experience. Your sense of entitlement is not okay, and I feel ashamed that tourists might be coming to your restaurant and experiencing this kind of treatment. Attitude like yours is why Toronto is not a true world class city.I will not be coming back here, but I hope you fix your customer service protocols.",

      'We were in Toronto this week and we went and tried Momofuku as it was supposed to be really good according to reviews. Wow, we were so disappointed with the quality of the food. Yes, the joint is very nicely decorated and looked impressive but the food is another story. We tried the "famous" chicken wings in beer batter. A beer batter is supposed to imply a crispy and light batter. It was the opposite! The coating was heavy (dense), hard and tough to chew. My Son had the Yuzu Ramen and it was overwhelmingly sour and salty. My Pork Ramen\'s broth does not have the taste of "real" Japanese rich pork broth. It strangely had a light sour taste to it which really turned me off of finishing it. Simply put, the meal was not close to being a good imitation-Japanese-Chinese food. Momofuku might have been good when it first started in NY but in Toronto, it is bad. I just can\'t understand how people can rate this place so highly. You can get much better Ramen at just about any Japanese noodle bar in TO. Try Hokkaido Santouka instead or better yet, go to Japan and set your bar from there.',

I'm not kidding, we looked at each others and said at the same time \"PFK\"! There's nothing original or even very good there.Next was th chicken ramen which was very oily and mostly average. Not very aromatic, the spiciness was interesting and not over heating. I 've had better, way better.One original characteristic is the milk and cookie bar! Where you can buy all sorts of cookies and cakes and stuff. I didn't try any as I was already kind of sad from the evening but it might be good.",
