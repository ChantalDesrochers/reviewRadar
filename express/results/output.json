Just our two cents.\n\nDESSERT\nSugar fanatics, this one's for you: They're offering up a trio of desserts created by Christina Tosi herself, the founder of Milk Bar.

The ramen was pretty good but not the best I've ever had. However, I thought the pork belly buns and milk bar ice cream were both top notch. We ordered the garlic ramen and the pork belly ramen. I actually wasn't the biggest fan of the type of ramen noodle used. It was a thin noodle which had a rather square shape. The noodle was also a bit firmer than I ideally like. I didn't dislike the noodle, it was just a bit different than my ideal noodle; I'm sure some people would love it though. The ramen broth for both bowls were good. The pork broth was less fatty than your standard tonkatsu ramen broth but a bit more salty. I like the spices they put into the pork broth to give the broth tiny bit of kick. The garlic broth was like a cross between a shoyu broth and a tonkatsu broth. The garlic and soy sauce flavors were definitely the base of the broth. The pork meat used were delicious and high quality. The egg is served soft boiled, almost raw in the broth. I liked the egg, but I think I would have preferred the traditional style of ramen egg boiled for slightly longer time.\n\nThe pork belly bun was one of the best I have ever had. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and there was probably double the amount of pork than most pork belly buns. The milk bar ice cream was simply delicious. We tried the cereal ice cream and the crack pie ice cream. The cereal ice cream is one of the most unique ice creams I have ever tried; yet it was also strangely very familiar because it actually tastes like a bowl of milk and cereal.","datePublished":"2018-05-11","summary":"The pork broth was less fatty than your standard tonkatsu ramen broth but a bit more salty.","concepts":[{"content":"soup"},{"content":"ice cream"},{"content":"stomach"},{"content":"noodle"}],"label":"positive","score":0.400976},{"id":11,"rating":"3.0","author":"Julia S.","origin":"Yelp","description":"for the ramen, the one in NYC still taste better. \npork belly steam bun is as good.\nnice that  they have small shop where you coild buy the milk bar cookies. our faves!\nif you love baking and want to make one yourself, william sonomas sell momofuku milk bar compost mix cokies, haven't tried myself though.","datePublished":"2018-07-04","summary":"Nice that they have small shop where you coild buy the milk bar cookies.","concepts":[{"content":"compass"},{"content":"tavern"},{"content":"cookie"},{"content":"biscuit"},{"content":"stomach"},{"content":"bun"},{"content":"store"},{"content":"bake"},{"content":"post"}],"label":"positive","score":0.363416},{"id":12,"rating":"3.0","author":"Mo649","origin":"TripAdvisor","description":"The pork bao wowed all of us.

We also got the kimchi jar and shrimp buns to start. The portions were seemingly small, but the kimchi jar was pretty densely packed and we surprisingly even had some left over by the end of the meal. The manager had recommended that we get the fluke, crab noodles, and rib. \n\nIf you love sashimi, the fluke will really wow you - it's raw but in a prosciutto kind of way. It was nice and smoked and when paired with the radishes was so yummy and refreshing. TBH we wanted to get two more of those dishes - one for the each of us .\n\nThe crab noodles are unfortunately seasonal. It is a dry noodle dish with a creamy coconut curry sauce and a deep fried soft shell crab on top - and it was so bomb! It was so good I didn't even wanna share it . \n\nThe rib was definitely the winner of the meal though. Holy it was actually huge and to my surprise, wasn't all bone.

I have made a few trips here before and been overall unimpressed. The ramen/noodle dishes were bland and overpriced and I found the benches on the main floor to be really uncomfortable. The service is curt and short. However, I came here with my husband's family for a celebratory dinner and it was really special. \n\nThe evening started with some cocktails and pork buns. I ordered the Impeachment ($14), which was utterly delicious. I don't like overly strong or sweet cocktails, and this was well balanced and quite sour. The pork belly buns is one of the best items on the menu. I would come here just to eat a few orders of these babies. The fried chicken dinner ($125) comes with a variety of accompaniments, including pickled vegetables, onion pancakes, sauces and lettuce (not that I ate any lettuce). The fried chicken is done two ways - a spicy Korean version and an American version. It was a decadent, messy and delicious dinner. I'm a huge fan of eating the chicken with the pancakes and accompaniments. \n\nThe perfect, sweet ending to the evening was the Milk Bar birthday cake, which is apparently flown in from the bakery in New York. I was expecting the cake to be one of those that looks good, but doesn't taste great, but I was really wrong.

Wow, we were so disappointed with the quality of the food. Yes, the joint is very nicely decorated and looked impressive but the food is another story. We tried the \"famous\" chicken wings in beer batter. A beer batter is supposed to imply a crispy and light batter. It was the opposite! The coating was heavy (dense), hard and tough to chew. My Son had the Yuzu Ramen and it was overwhelmingly sour and salty. My Pork Ramen's broth does not have the taste of \"real\" Japanese rich pork broth. It strangely had a light sour taste to it which really turned me off of finishing it. Simply put, the meal was not close to being a good imitation-Japanese-Chinese food. Momofuku might have been good when it first started in NY but in Toronto, it is bad. I just can't understand how people can rate this place so highly. You can get much better Ramen at just about any Japanese noodle bar in TO. Try Hokkaido Santouka instead or better yet, go to Japan and set your bar from there.","datePublished":"2018-07-5","summary":"We were in Toronto this week and we went and tried Momofuku as it was supposed to be really good according to reviews.","concepts":[{"content":"food"},{"content":"soup"},{"content":"tavern"},{"content":"compass"},{"content":"ale"}],"label":"very negative","score":-0.593874},{"id":29,"rating":"2.0","author":"Shubhi A.","origin":"Yelp","description":"Did not like the food and service... \nthis place had been on my list for a while but it left to a big disappointment.
