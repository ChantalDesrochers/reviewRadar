Hands down. Either location is perfection. I've never been let down by anything I eat here and honestly, I would probably pick this place over any fine dining restaurant. I love this place so much that I brought my partner of 3 years here on our very first date. We still come here every two weeks or so. \n\nMy favourite items include:\n\n- Kimchi Fries: the OG of all fries. Forget poutine. Seriously. These fries will blow your mind. A generous helping of kimchi and pulled pork, slathered in mayo and topped on fries that somehow never get soggy. It's perfect.\n\n- The Grilled Pork Bahn Mi: perfect sandwich. This sandwich was my first Bahn Mi Boys love. It's my classic go-to. Thick baguette bread filled with delicious pork, pickled veggies (probably my fave part, they really balance out the heaviness of the other components) and addictive sauces. I think this also comes with mayo. I literally add their mayo to everything, so if I'm wrong and mayo isn't the default...ADD MAYO! \n\n- Every Steamed Bao: they are all awesome. Seriously. The soft steamed buns are like clouds. My favourite is probably the Fried Chicken Bao and the Pork Belly Bao...but if you can't decide between the two, get the secret menu item: The Club Bao. This is a combination of the fried chicken and the pork belly all in one. As I mentioned before, if it doesn't come with mayo, definitely add mayo. It just adds a little something-something. \n\nI've also tried an assortment of their tacos.

We finally got the chance during Doors Open Toronto, when we did a tour of several buildings within the vicinity of Nathan Phillips Square, and this restaurant happened to be within reasonable walking distance. I remember reading that this location has limited seating so we tried to be here ahead of the Saturday lunch crowd. The restaurant is on the northside of Queen St W, with a small facade and narrow interior that extend to the back. Past the front door, there were a few 2-seater and 4-seater tables on the left, a narrow side counter on the right, order counter/cashier next, and finally kitchen/order pick-up at the very back. We ordered grilled pork banh mi ($6.50), grilled chicken banh mi ($7), 5 spice pork belly steamed bao ($4.25) and kimchi fries ($7.50). Wait time was fast, 8 mins! They call your name and you get your tray at order pick-up, add condiments if you want, and grab napkins and cutleries on your way back to the table. Sandwiches were good. My husband complained about the crusty bread which was really his fault for missing the ‘baguette’ part on the menu board. Kimchi fries were different but tasty.The restaurant got full pretty quick and most customers ended up ordering takeout or eating standing up beside the narrow side counter. At first, tables were comfortably spaced apart but once table-separating started, it was a tight squeeze getting in or out of the bright red banquette seating. Separate male and female single-user graffiti-filled washrooms are located downstairs. When we were here, only one washroom was available for use.","datePublished":"2018-06-24","summary":"Past the front door, there were a few 2-seater and 4-seater tables on the left, a narrow side counter on the right, order counter/cashier next, and finally kitchen/order pick-up at the very back.","concepts":[{"content":"$"},{"content":"restaurant"},{"content":"pick"},{"content":"side"},{"content":"french fries"}],"label":"negative","score":-0.0929673},{"id":48,"rating":"5.0","author":"Rosa A","origin":"TripAdvisor","description":"Always a stop while in Toronto.
