Hands down. Either location is perfection. I've never been let down by anything I eat here and honestly, I would probably pick this place over any fine dining restaurant. I love this place so much that I brought my partner of 3 years here on our very first date. We still come here every two weeks or so. \n\nMy favourite items include:\n\n- Kimchi Fries: the OG of all fries. Forget poutine. Seriously. These fries will blow your mind. A generous helping of kimchi and pulled pork, slathered in mayo and topped on fries that somehow never get soggy. It's perfect.\n\n- The Grilled Pork Bahn Mi: perfect sandwich. This sandwich was my first Bahn Mi Boys love. It's my classic go-to. Thick baguette bread filled with delicious pork, pickled veggies (probably my fave part, they really balance out the heaviness of the other components) and addictive sauces. I think this also comes with mayo. I literally add their mayo to everything, so if I'm wrong and mayo isn't the default...ADD MAYO! \n\n- Every Steamed Bao: they are all awesome. Seriously. The soft steamed buns are like clouds. My favourite is probably the Fried Chicken Bao and the Pork Belly Bao...but if you can't decide between the two, get the secret menu item: The Club Bao. This is a combination of the fried chicken and the pork belly all in one. As I mentioned before, if it doesn't come with mayo, definitely add mayo. It just adds a little something-something. \n\nI've also tried an assortment of their tacos.
