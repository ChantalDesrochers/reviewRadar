      "I was introduced to Fresh by a friend and I return time and time again for the tasty vegetarian food - my faves include the Jerusalem salad, the BBQ ‘burger’ with the quinoa onion rings and the dosas (which are not served during weekend brunch).The service is casual but attentive and the eclectic mix of guests adds to the buzzy vibe.My only criticism is the narrow space and tables, which sometimes make for a wee exercise in acrobatics and shape-shifting in order to settle in or get out.",

The Buddha bowl offered up the right mix of veg and tofu for me and the peanut sauce was thick and rich. The hot sauce was a great addition to my bowl and I came pretty close to drinking it. the regular size bowls are monsters so if you are medium hungry or ordering apps go for the smaller bowl. Also go do a over rice for a nearly pad Thai flavor If you want something refreshing I recommend the lemon aid, but adult beverages are also available ",

The line up from the door never ended which in itself if a good example of what awaits you. I definitely will be going back there often while in Toronto and encourage anyone to try this spot even if not vegan or vegetarian you will be pleasantly surprised and it may convert you to no longer eat animal flesh. The servers are very pleasant and make sure you are happy with what you ordered. Cannot say enough about this place. It was a gold find.",

      "So I was trying this place as I was in the mood for a vegan brunch. Ordered the Pancake breakfast plate with an Americano coffee. First the coffee was brought by a male waiter shaking the cup with the saucer serving me the spilled over saucer and cup without even offering to get tissues to clean it. I asked the female waitress after to put the coffee in a large paper cup because it was full up to the rim and shouldn’t be even served that way (hang on guys this was the nothing compared to what happened next). Next came the pancake dish looking good. Started eating the almond berry pancakes and it was tasting really good I suddenly see a long thin thread like thing coming from inside the pancake mix (yes it was a hair) the waitress was beside me when it happened. Shocked and apologetic she took the plate and came back with another plate minutes later giving me also two coupons for limited choices of free smoothies. I was really hungry. I really wanted to finish that plate and leave. As I was eating the second plate I noticed the other side of the pancake was uncooked. It was not flipped and the whole thing tasted like flour. In the rush to make amends the chef must have tried to serve me quickly but again failed to match the better tasting pancakes (sans hair) that I had the first time. Telling the waitress this time that I will sadly not eat this and pay only for the coffee. She was upset for what happened to me. She honestly was a really good waitress but here’s my thoughts. She should have checked the second plate before she served i and told the reckless chef to redo it. In any case I had to leave and go to the opposite What A Bagel where I had my usual great breakfast. Hopefully these guys get better in quality and service. ",

      "Mostly vegan restaurant with quite an attitude. Our first time at Fresh on Spadina and an unfriendly hostess tried to sit us right outside the kitchen area. There were several other tables open and I asked to be seated elsewhere. She was irritated by my request but took us to a tight table between two other groups of diners when there were several other small tables available. People like that should not be in a hostess position. Once our waitress introduced herself things somewhat improved. Overall the food was just OK. Their entrees are filled with fatty ingredients and fatty foods. I did not feel good after eating there. With so many other wonderful vegan restaurants in Toronto, I would not go back to this one.",

      "So I over indulged as I was so excited to have so many options. Here is what we tried...Onion rings - wow so funBuffalo Bites - so amazing I ordered a to go of this item BEST cauliflower buffalo bites I have ever eaten amazing textureBuffalo Chick Wrap - has the buffalo bites in it so can't go wrongCeasar Salad - dressing was amazing and loved the greensCauliflower taco - good but not my favMushroom Bacon Burger - decent but I felt it was missing something so I used some of the onion ring dip on it and that helpedCocktails very nice expensive but fancy. Only reason I am not giving a 5 star is the walk to the bathroom was very concerning... You walk by the kitchen through a crowded hallway which appears to be kitchen stock room. Being your clients go back there I feel your floor should be squeaky clean in the hall as well as kitchen area. It was mess! Service is a bit slow but the server rocked!",
