Our reservation had hand cligraphied cards on them! We ordered fried chicken, torched salmon, takoyaki and black sesame ice cream, they were all superb! Cheaper than most Japanese restaurants with solid food quality and a fun atmosphere, what more can you ask for?\nThe only little complaint i have is the salmon was not as torched (charred) as what we had in Montreal's Kinka, so it was less good, but overall still a place I would return to regularly if I lived in Toronto!",

Staff will find any reason to yell and make noise, whether it's a customer entering or leaving, or a dish comes out of the kitchen, or anything else. Definitely the kind of atmosphere that encourages you to raise your own voices.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the volume, fortunately they also have a patio that is much quieter. During colder seasons, it would be covered up and adequately heated, so the option is available year-round as long as they choose to offer it.\n\nWe came for some mega karaage. I don't know if it's on the regular menu, but they make some pretty good fried chicken. Super crisp skin, nice juicy meat. They have a waiter checking up on the patio frequently enough, with water refills and asking how things are doing.\n\nI don't know how the regular items are like, but if they've got karaage normally I'd come back for more.",

In addition we got the cheese bake mussels and takoyaki. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ramen and said it was comparable to Sensotei. The sashimi was fresh and the appetizers we shared were super tasty. The cheese mussels though are really saucy and rich- just an FYI! \n\nI really enjoyed the environment as it was fun and casual. However the service was slow, but the waitress was really nice - just get their attention if something is needed. Will definitely be coming back. :) \n\nVisited: December 10th 2017",

      'True, you will never get the absolutely exact experience that you would get in Japan, outside of the country, but Kinka (formerly named "Guu)" is a very authentic experience, from the decor all the way down to the food.The wait staff is super nice, super friendly and super attentive. The decor, I find, to be somewhat similar to Okariba, in Kyoto (wood everywhere), though Kinka is not reminiscent of a hunting lodge/hut. The food is incredible though, anything from Sahsimi, to Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki and other dishes; they also have fusion dishes, combining cooked oysters with cheese and pumpkin with Brie (not a fan of Brie).While not cheap, its not expensive either, thus Kinka is far from a restaurant that you should avoid.',

It was pretty empty actually with only a couple other tables so the service was excellent. Hubby had the salmon don and it was really good. Large portions of fresh chunks of sushi salmon paired with sushi rice and a really delicious sauce on top. Everyone in our group agreed the salmon don was great value. (Comes with miso soup and salad)\nThey have an extensive sake menu and lots of different tapas to try, it's a great lounge spot and hearing the kitchen yelling in Japanese to greet you is lots of fun. :)",

      "Only 11.50$!! Came here for lunch and got an amazing negi-toro don with soup and salad for only 11.50$ - a really great value. The tuna was decently fatty and flavourful, mixed well with enough green onion and grated wasabi. Highly recommended!\n\nLunch time is less crowded with more attentive service, definitely great if you're saving the saké bombs for another night! Still love the warm welcomes and farewells that the staff chants together.",

If you find the entrance, you are immediately welcomed with great hello (and of course, when going out again also). Sure, it is quite noisy but we felt very comfortable. The service was very friendly and attentive and explained a lot to us. The food was indescribable good and everything the people around me had also looked fantastic. And the dessert (Green Tea Creme Brulee) was also amazing! Hopefully I'll come back here sometime.",

      "Highly recommend making a reservation for Kinka! It's incredible Japanese food, the flavors were Umani Central.\n\nWe ordered a few things to try from the menu, the standout dishes were the Karaage and the Seared Tuna. Runner up is the Yakiudon. I suggest you go with 3 - 4 people, so you can order a few items to try. They do offer \"lunch sets\", which are a great variety, but if you want to try more than .a few items, fo with friends.\n\nThe staff is super nice and the even though we came at the end of lunch, you can feel that it's a very lively place.\n\nPro Tip: be careful when eating the takoyaki balls, they will burn your mouth if you don't let them cool down. seriously super hot!! They were great but I did burn the roof of my mouth.",

      "5/5 for sure! Right off the bat, the reservations were very easy to make (made them through YELP), and they even followed up with a confirmation text a few days leading up to the event. \n\nI came here for my birthday with a few of my friends and the experience was phenomenal. As soon as you enter the door, you are greeted with an outburst of japanese waiters who make you feel welcomed. The place is not too big, hence the reason for reservations to be made. \n\nFood - As a group of 6 we decided to split and share a bunch of food items. We tried \n*Karaage - which was HUGE! It came with about 4-6 pieces and they were the size of about a small fist or less, but definitely worth it. \n*Ikapiri - calamari in sweet/spicy like sauce. They sprinkled crispy onions on the top of it, making the texture crispy, yet soft at the same time. \n*Takoyaki - octopus ball, with flour and a piece of octopus in it. Pretty flavourful and good. Presentable. Even texture throughout, but could use a little bit of a bigger piece of octopus on the inside. Be careful when biting into it, it might be a little hot!! Rich in flavour, but not too heavy. \n*Kinoko bibimbap - was better than the kimchi bibimbap in comparison, but both were really good. This bibimbap was focused on mushrooms, with a variation of seaweed. MMMM YUM! We ended up ordering two! \n*Kimchi bibimbap - very flavourful. More focused on flavour rather than spice. It's not too bad, but I prefer the Kinoko bibimbap. \n*Birthday assorted desserts - Came with grapefruit, almond pudding, 2 slices of caramel/coffee roll cake?, and black sesame & coconut icecream. \n\nAMAZING 5/5 QUALITY JAP FOOD EXPERIENCE! Defeinitely would recommend. \n\nDrinks- Try out these FUN drinks if you want to have a blast with your friends. They make it a whole experience and get everybody's attention in the restaurant. This is worth the video recording and definitely worth the try if you come here, you should get at least one of these drinks. THURSDAYS -- $3!! \n*Sake bombs - Sapporo beer & Sake shot sitting on top of chopsticks. \n*Samurai bombs - Sapporo beer & Fruity drink mix & Sake Shot --huge!!\n\nService/Environment - Excellent. Attentive. They explained very well that the table is reserved after us for 9pm which is completely understandable, and still enough time to eat comfortable. They have fast food service, and even if  you order in a trickle (different dishes) -- they can cater to it (but it's better to order everything up front). \n\n\nParking- I parked at the pay for parking right across the restaurant. Very convenient. FUN. \n\nWould 100% come back and recommend it to my friends. It makes you feel like you're in Japan, and you're immersed into their izakaya culture as soon as you walk through the doors. Please try this gem out!",

      "Great atmosphere:- The staff greet you warmly as you enter and leave the restaurant.- Really nice decor (IMO), lots of wood, high ceilings and windows allowing in lots of light on a rainy day. - music that is not overly loud so you can still have a conversation with the ppl you're with- One section, you have to take off your shoes. Non issue as the floors were very clean. Shoes are left under the aisle side seat below you. - mouthwash and toothpicks in the washroom is always a plus- Washrooms are clean and private (no stalls or shared room, just one washroom per person)Service:- Great, prompt for the whole service (ordering, refilling water without asking, bringing the bill and machine when needed)- everyone was polite and not irritated, no complaints. Food:- Kurage (marinated jellyfish) - good taste, fresh and nicely seasoned. will order again- Kabo koro? (Deep fried pumpkin croquette with boiled egg inside covered with spicy mayo) - interesting layer of flavours. Worth trying at least once. The pumpkin was the star of that trio. Note there were also some deep fried seaweed toppings. While they were appreciated, they were also forgettable/barely noticed other than for presentation purposes. - gyu shabu salad - pleasant surprise. Since this was topped with shabu beef (boiled) I thought this would be lacking in flavour. However, it was a light, refreshing salad packed with just the right amount of everything. The light taste of the black sesame dressing would be the reason why I would order this again - blow torched, press salmon sushi - I have been spoiled with jabistro pressed sushi that it kind of ruins pressed sushi from other joints. Nothing compares to theirs, but for the price point I would easily recommend this dish to others that enjoy this type of sushi.- matcha creme brûlée - nice finish to dinner. Delicate flavours and the top had just the right texture for this kind of dessert. It also comes with a tiny scoop of green tea ice cream. Overall - Came early during dinner and was able to get a table without a reservation. In a sea of izakayas on this strip, i would recommend this particular restaurant based on my experience. The patio looks like a great place to hang out in warmer weather and I will be back to share some more dishes and drinks with friends.ps. Forgot to take a photo of the jellyfish -_-\"",

      "I haven't been here since Guu days but was pleasantly surprised to find their menu hasn't changed much at all. Interior is cozy with dim lighting. The atmosphere is lively and the servers are very enthusiastic so expect lots and lots of shouting when you enter and throughout your whole meal - it's all part of the experience.\n\nFor our drinks we got the Kinka Fizz and the Sky of Tokyo - both cocktails were delicious and refreshing!\n\nWe shared the kinoko bibimbap, chicken karaage, hotate scallops, takoyaki, and salmon tataki. I would highly recommend the kinoko bibimbap - it's basically mushrooms, cheese, and rice served in a stone bowl and it tastes good! The karaage was good but I found the pieces to be too big for my liking. Scallops were so fresh, reminds me of the ones from Japan. The takoyaki is decent and you can't ever go wrong with ordering their salmon tataki served with garlic chips.\n\nFun place to go for a date or with friends! Food-wise I give it 3.5 stars because for me only a few of their dishes are memorable enough to be repeat orders - the rest are decent or average. The portions can also be rather small for the price. I have to say that the drinks are really good here though and same with the service so +0.5 stars for that!",

      "Went for lunch on Wednesday with my 2 friends. The seats were 1/4 filled and it was really warm inside. There were music/songs playing and I felt that the volume was kind of loud. I ordered the Miso ramen + Gyu Carpaccio. My friends ordered the regular size Karaage Don, Gomaae, Tako Wasabi and Donburi with salmon sashimi. \n\nI am a huge ramen lover, but honestly, I didn't appreciate the Miso ramen that I ordered. I'd rather have a ramen at near-by Kinton, Sansotei or Santouka. I usually finish most of the soup whenever I have ramen, but this time I left it half way. \n\nAs for the appetizers, I loved it. Guy Carpaccio was yummy, except that it doesn't look like the picture that has been posted on Yelp by the restaurant. I also think that it is a bit overpriced ($7.50) for 5 thin slices of beef. Tako Wasabi was good too, we could taste the octopus, and there was lots of wasabi. To be enjoyed little by little. \n\nDonburis came with a miso soup and a side salad. Karaage Don came with pieces of fried chicken and the bowl was filled completely. My friend who had the salmon one was still kind of hungry after the meal. So if you're someone who has a good appetite, go with the Karaage Don. \n\nFood: 3.5/5\nPrice: 3/5\nService: 3.75/5",

      "This place is amazing! My friend and I have been coming here every Thursday for more than a week for the $3 sake bombs. Every time we order one, they do the whole sake bomb chant that lights up the entire atmosphere. Pitchers are a bit pricy at around $18, but the atmosphere is super lively. This place always cheers me up. \n\nI also always get the karaage, which is similar to the one you get from Kinton (since owned by same parent restaurant), which is delicious and crispy but there's usually only 4 pieces. The salmon tataki and is delicious and fresh. If you go for your birthday, they'll have a huge board and get the entire restaurant to sing happy birthday for you, which is freaking awesome. \n\ni've also gone for lunch for their cheap $8 shoyu ramen. It's light and the pork is kind of hard to chew, but the noodles are worth the price. They also have a delicious karaage don and I don't know why they don't offer this at kinton, but it's super good!",

      "After a long nap on a Friday evening, I was looking forward to some cozy Japanese food for dinner. We made a reservation for Kinka Izakaya a bit earlier, and luckily the restaurant was busy but not so packed that we didn't have to wait to be seated in this dimly lit, but boisterous little restaurant.\n\nImmediately upon entering the venue, it was clear that the vibe was not unlike a real izakaya--a Japanese pub or tavern--you could find in Japan. The wooden decor, the dim lighting, and the small-plates style of serving all pointed to the same authentic vibe. The servers all greet you when you enter, say goodbye when you leave, and cheer when anyone in the restaurant orders a sake bomb. It's no question that it's all kinds of fun here!\n\nMy friends and I split a decent number of dishes, the most memorable I'll talk about here:\n\n-Gyu Carpaccio: This seared sashimi featured ponzu, wasabi mayo, and garlic chips on top. The meat was tender and the sauce was a mix of rich and acidic, which was a nice balance to the meat.\n-Salmon Tataki: This is the seafood equivalent of the gyu carpaccio. The flavor profile of the sauces were quite similar, but the protein was simply different. Though to be honest, I prefer salmon simply because I like fish more than I like most meats. Regardless, both dishes were quite good and the fattiness of the meat was rich and balanced out well.\n-Karaage: This is your pretty classic Japanese fried chicken. The soy sauce marinade and the garlic mayo was a nice classic dish.\n-Gindara: The grilled miso black cod was surprisingly delicate and delicate in flavor. There were some bones in the dish which wasn't much of a problem, but it was definitely a more delicate dish than what we expected. In comparison to the saba (described below), I think my friends and I preferred the saba.\n-Saba: Yum! I personally love grilled mackerel. Kinka Izakaya does a great (classic) execution of this grilled fish with a bit of salt and lemon on a sizzling dish. The crispy/flaky dichotomy was well done and flavorful.\n-Tonpei Yaki: This egg dish with pan-fried pork, bean sprouts, and cabbage was similar to okonomiyaki. Though to be honest I didn't quite like how they rendered the pork (it was a bit fatty for me), but I still thought the dish and its sauces were executed well.\n-Unagi Doria: This eel over rice as a pretty classic take on an eel donburi. The eel was well done and tasted just as one would expect, but I was a big fan of the rice. The grains felt like they had a little bite to them like brown rice, but overall was flavorful in comparison to most steamed rices that unagi is often served on top of instead.\n\nTo finish all this off, we also split a matcha tiramisu. I'll say I quite appreciated the flavor of it in contrast to the traditional coffee/liqueur flavoring, since this felt a little earthier and lighter in comparison. Looks like it's a seasonal special though, so keep an eye out for it!\n\nThis meal was a wild night and the portions were perfectly sized. Despite getting to sample so much, I wasn't stuffed! Can't wait to come back here for a sampling of their other dishes, or even their gigantic katsu they serve on Wednesday nights. Guess I'll have to make another trip up to Toronto soon...",

The food is cooked fresh to order right in view and it's delicious. The cold tapas are fantastic if you are a sushi fan. Excellent customer service. Took a little time to get a table but food came out fast and was worth it. ",

      "We came around 6pm on a Friday. As soon as I walked in, this place reminded me of Guu. Even the specials menu had the same font as a Guu I've previously visited. \n\nWe started off with a pitcher of Sapporo and ordered a bunch of Japanese tapas, mostly fried. \ntakowasabi - marinated octopus w/ wasabi stem. the wasabi is incredibly intense, be careful of having too much in one bite unless you love that refreshing wasabi feeling.\ntakoyaki \nokonomiyaki\nFried brie - for cheese lovers\nScallops - not as good as the Guu in Vancouver since it was smaller and less flavorful. still good value imo.\nkaraage\ndeep fried calamari \n\nBeer paired well with all the fried foods, so I'd highly recommend that. Had a festive time here with the good company, drinks, and food. 2 hour seating maximum in case you have too much fun.",

      "Kinka Izakaya is a Japanese tapas restaurant. I think they were formally known as GUU, or at least things seem VERY similar to GUU. As expect, the place sells typical izakaya thing - most of which are deep fried meats, assortments of raw and cooked fish, and a small plethora of sake and beer. Would 100% come back, this place is awesome!\n\nThe moment you walk in, the whole restaurant is screaming at you welcoming you. Obviously if you don't want a loud place to dine at, this isn't for you! There is a 2 hour seating policy, mainly because it's super fun here. There are some tables, but there are several long benches you share with others.\n\nOrdered: All good stuff, \nScallops\nDeep fried brie\nKarage fried chicken\nFried seafood pancake\nTakiyaki fried octopus\nWasabi squid - VERY SPICEY\nBamboo of sake - quite a lot of booze\nPitcher of Saporro",

      "Pretty solid spot for izakaya fare in Toronto.\n\nMy friend and I came for a late lunch on Monday around 1 pm. I had previously made reservations a couple hours beforehand just in case, but the whole restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived so they weren't really necessary.\n\nThey have a small outdoor seating area on their patio, which is where we opted to sit since it was such a nice day outside. I was pretty hungry since I hadn't eaten all morning, so we shared:\n\n-karaage ($9.90): a little bland but otherwise delicious. Skin was light and crispy and it wasn't too oily\n\n-okonomiyaki ($8.90): comes with 4 pre-cut pieces which makes it great for sharing. Thought this was pretty solid as well\n\n-kalbi ($9.90): a little disappointed in this dish as the kalbi flavor wasn't very strong. I had ordered a bowl of rice to eat with this but didn't finish the full bowl, since the kalbi was a little bit blander than expected\n\n-almond tofu ($4.90): my friend had never had this dessert before but he really liked it. Thick creamy tofu with a delicious almond flavor...yum!!\n\nWe ended up paying ~$60 for this meal for the two of us, which includes a miso soup and a cocktail as well. A bit on the pricey side for lunch, but hey, what's vacation for if not splurging? :D",

It's one of those lovely places where they yell at you with cheer when you walk in and when you leave. \nThey play hip hop and rap mostly (which I love). Really cool design with lots of wood. \nServices is great. They really know the menu, are super friendly and very fast. \nWe tried allllll the things. We went with a lot of suggestions from our server. \nI would r suggest the plum wine. Tasted a bit like cough syrup but I think it's just an squired taste. \nThe food was out of this world. \nWe got the sashimi salad, salmon tataki (so good we ordered another round), gyu carpaccio, the spicy tuna, gyoza, Octopus balls, kakimayo oysters (we ordered a second round of those too. Kind of like oysters Rockefeller), kinoko bibmbap. \nWould go back for sure!!",

First off, the atmosphere was really fun.  They offer sake bombs so you will hear people screaming and banging on the tables every few minutes.  The food was served tapas style and I got to try about 6-7 different dishes which were all really good.  The ones that stood out to me were the oysters(kakimayo), salmon tataki, and the yaki udon.

      "We brought a 12 year old Australian riesling with us to celebrate my birthday with my favourite food - Japanese. This restaurant by the reviews appeared to be the one. When we got there to order our takeout....we were so pleased on our decision not to eat in as it was sooooo noisy....it would have been impossible to have a conversation. Unfortunately the menu on their website is way out of date...so we had to order different dishes to our original plan. When we got the order back to our hotel room we found instead of 2 serves of salmon salad dish they gave us 2 serves of tuna (does that mean they couldn't hear us either!!) not what we wanted at all and the eel dish....well.....where was the eel....did someone forget to put it in the container?! The highlight of my special birthday dinner was the riesling that had travelled all the way from OZ, it was spectacular!",

      "WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nTheir sake bombs. It's a popular drink here! For $5 you get a shot of sake in a cup of beer. But not only that, you get to experience the fun part of having the whole restaurant get all revved up as you take this same bomb challenge. A waiter will yell sake and you yell bomb. After three instances of shouting back and forth, you rumble the table to have the sake shot drop into your beer before downing it in one go. Quite fun!\n\nTheir tapas style dishes are great too. I recommend the sashimi dishes here and the takoyaki too. You can see in my pictures what I had and I loved all the dishes I ordered! \n\nThe ambiance in this restaurant has always been loud and lively so if you're not up for that, this restaurant may not be the best choice for you. Many come here for a birthday celebration or celebrating something because the bigger your group, the more it is when you do a sake bomb. \n\nThe only thing I want to warn you is about the pace of the service. Because they are so busy, sometimes it will take a bit longer for them to get the food to you or they simply forgot about your beer order. So be patient and be prepared to follow up with a waiter on your order!!\n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nThe bill can quickly add up because you want to try everything but a good rule of thumb is to order two dishes per person to start and then order more as you go along your meal! Enjoy the izakaya!!",

      "Very lively atmosphere here with staff that are super enthusiastic! The staff are constantly yelling at full energy for whenever someone enters, exits, an order is read, someone orders a sake bomb, etc. It's truly a bustling environment that gives you a really warm and energetic feeling, but it is very loud. Don't expect to be able to speak to your fellow diners very well without losing your voice.\n\nThe food itself was sort of hit and miss. We ordered the set menu to be able to try a variety of the menu. At $40 a person, it's not too bad (note: each dish portion that comes out is to be shared with all set menu people). The items I really enjoyed were the salmon tataki and kaki mayo. The other items were evenly split into \"okay\" or \"salt explosion\" categories.\n\nI can't quite say if I'd come back again. The food is sort of overpriced for the majority of the items, considering I felt the quality or complexity wasn't there. There are a few things I would come back to try again, but I personally prefer dining environments where I have ease conversing with friends. Food is a social experience for me, so despite the lively and fun environment KINKA offers, it's really too hard to talk to people!",

Since there was only 2 of us, we only ordered a few from their staple menu, baked oysters, takoyaki, karaage, bibimbap with a pint of beer each.\n\nWhile the food came out mostly delicious, the portions have changed - especially apparent in the size of oysters, like one was significantly smaller than the other. The takoyaki wasn't crispy at all on the outside, the chicken sizes weren't similar so a few pieces came out a little pink on the inside. \n\nThe server was a bit hard to flag down, but the few times she came to our table, was friendly and helpful.

We are foodies and where sampling a lot of the dishes. As we are gluten free the options where so restricted we got the chef Abiru to make us up some dishes. He made us a GF octopus poke and a pork poke very nice. He really made it special for us. Now i did notice a lot of people eat 1 meal and share it in 2. So not our style so they where amazed that we eat 1 meal each. The rest of the restaurant went and came fast and we stayed sampling european style. Not something we would have done inside with the screaming. Highly recommended",

However this time I was there for my Burffday and I was ready to relax and have some fun with my partner in crime. \n\nSo let's get started...Walking in here is a a warm screaming welcome so that's always fun. I was here on a Thursday and it was sake bomb night. If you end up at this place, you have to try at least once. Now I have had sake bombs at a lot of places and I'm sure so have you. But this place it's an experience you must try. It gets loud and every server gets into it and lets just say the birdffday was on its way. \n\nFood was just as I remembered it..Deeelicious for th most part. We had the tuna sashimi, the salmon sashimi, beef carpaccio to start and they were all delicious. Carpaccio was Bomb so def try that. We also got the yellowfin sashimi and wel let's just say same as above, fresh and yummy. We then got the pork belly bao buns and to be fair I am a huge bao bun snob but the pork belly was cooked perfectly and they were excellent. We also got scallop sashimi, the spare ribs and well lots of SAKE...smooth and yummy. \n\nThe only thing we didn't like was the pork dish, it seemed a bit under seasoned and happened to be cold so we had to send it back.  \n\nLastly we got the matcha cheesecake with matcha ice cream and that was mind blowing. It was a perfect cap to the meal and birthday.",

I think it's a part of their vibe to be rowdy and loud but it wasn't appealing to me. \n\nTL;DR Good food, but you'll have to yell to hear who you came with.",

      "Came here for lunch with my sister! Unfortunately, there is less variety at lunch than at dinner, and the portions tend to be quite overpriced. All lunch sets are at a minimum $10.\n\nI ordered the salmon don, which came with three pieces of flame torched salmon, and chopped pieces of salmon marinated with soy sauce. All this sat on a bed of marinated kelp, on top of the white rice. The marinade was very good but slightly salty, and soaked right through to the rice. The salmon was very tasty, but quite stringy and chewy (definitely consisted of the rougher cuts of meat). The seared salmon had a very rich and delicious smokey flavour. As this was a set, it came with miso soup and salad (which was topped with crunchy fried daikon chips).\n\nMy sister got the karaage don, which came with roughly five pieces of small karaage and a bit of lettuce. It was okay, but definitely not their best that I've had. The batter was slightly thicker than what I remember.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but not amazing. Next time, I might just come for dinner instead.",

      "One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Think of it as Japanese tapas food. Great place for groups as the dishes are smaller and meant for sharing so you are able to try a lot of different things. I've taken a lot of people here and it's always a hit. \n\nEverything on the menu is great, but the must tries are the Brie Cheese (deep fried cheese), Ebimayo (deep fried prawns), Karaage (deep fried chicken), Kakimayo (baked oyster with cheese). These are my favourite dishes and always crowd favourites. Other notable mentions include the udon and bibimbap! \n\nFeeling boozy? All of their cocktails are great, but if you want something more adventurous get the Sake Bomb. If that's not enough try the Seven Samurai. Both options, get ready for some shots, chugging and lots of yelling! Definitely something to try at least once!",

      "If you're in any way an introvert that hates attention, OR one easily overstimulated by loud noises or crowds, I would steer clear of Kinka Izakaya. But, if you can roll with such things and you enjoy delicious Japanese food, I highly recommend this place.\n\nWhen you walk into the joint be prepared, EVERYONE gets a welcome. There's shouting, cheering and more in Japanese. A lot of the seating is communal but we were lucky to grab a table for two fairly easily on a Saturday night. We had to wait about 10 minutes but a light stroll down the street kept us occupied until they called us to let us know our table was ready. \n\nAs the name suggests, it's izakaya-style dining, which means we plowed through a large number of plates at our table. Some highlights: salmon tataki (seared atlantic salmon sashimi w/ ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips & scallion), the salmon collar, karaage (deep fried soy sauce\nmarinated chicken w/ garlic mayo), and the karubi (grilled salt & pepper beef short ribs w/ scallion sauce). But everything we had was a winner.\n\nPrice isn't too terrible either for a special night out. For the two of us we walked out of there stuffed for around $70. I've certainly spent more on less food of lesser quality in Toronto, so this was a nice surprise.",

But basically, this is a fun restaurant to go to on a late night if you want Japanese style tapas.  Their small dishes are not cheap and if you are going in hungry, it can become one expensive meal.  However, everything we've ordered has been very tasty.  Some of their highlights include lobster sashimi (which they have in the summer sometimes), their almond tofu (to die for), and their karaage chicken (because who can go wrong with fried chicken)? \n\nThis is certainly a very loud place to be at with all the patrons talking and the waiters and waitresses yelling every few seconds when someone comes in.

They're blaring 90s pop and hip-hop hits and seating is family style at picnic tables. It's. So. Cool!!! We waited over an hour to eat here, and I would gladly wait another. \n\nFrom what I could tell, their menu rotates frequently with specials that are flown in that day - and sell out FAST! Everything we ate was fantastic. I wish I had taken pics! \n\nThe other thing that is fantastic are the $5 saki bombs. And the fact that when you order one, your waitress starts a screaming chant that the entire restaurant joins in on - each time you order one. I felt a little bad because our server had to get another employee to lead the chant after we threw back so many she lost her voice. \n\nService was perfect. Food was impeccable.

      'This restaurant boasts unique and sophisticated Japanese food but the flavors weren\'t strong enough to leave an impression. The noise level and long shared picnic tables and shouting made it oddly reminiscent of a German Biergarten. At the end of the night. The waiters approached tables near us no less than 6 times over the time we were there to boisterously yell some rhymes or sayings that encourage the table to drink whatever they ordered that I\'m guessing comes with yelling on the side. The waiter did not speak enough English to understand our order. The rapini with sesame sauce that other reviewers rave about was just that -- some boiled spinach with a dark sesame sauce on it. The Gyozo were unremarkable. The mackerel fishy. The black cod was super tender and delicious with subtle flavors. It was, as some have written, "casual" and "super lively." The yelling was just too much.',

      "I want to preface this review by saying that this place looks fun to visit as a large group. They have big communal tables, lots of noise, and sake bombs galore. I came alone (I was visiting Toronto for a few days), and this was just not what I was looking for. First, it was very loud. The gimmick is that the servers shout in Japanese whenever someone comes through the door, leaves, places an order, there's an order up, or gets a sake bomb. In the latter case, the servers chant while the person bangs loudly on the table. Again - probably fun if you're into that kind of thing, but otherwise just very loud. I ordered two things - the yuzu tofu (similar to agadashi tofu) which arrived pretty soggy unfortunately, and the special oyster hot pot, which had exactly one oyster and the rest was cabbage (taste was okay though). I was also very crowded. On the bright side, the servers were very polite and attentive and clearly working very hard. I just can't really recommend this place based on the atmosphere or the food.",

      "This is a typical Izakaya but overall I had a just average experience.\n\nThe ambience is full of people screaming at the top of their lungs and drumming, which was pretty annoying if you're trying to talk at all. I did like how in summers they have an outdoors dining patio area, which is much better and quieter than the inside. The poor staff were literally losing their voice from yelling.\n\nThe food was standard izakaya fare. Pretty good but nothing stood out. The more adventurous sounding menu items like the fried pumpkin croquette was just heavy and weirdly flavoured. I wouldn't say bad, but nothing I'd order again.\n\nThe service was adequate since they always have a full house. We were able to get in with some waiting without making any reservations on a Friday night around 6 PM.\n\nOverall I'd rate them much higher if there wasn't so much unnecessary screaming. I get the fun and loud environment part of it but there's a limit. Having a normal conversation, we would get interrupted every minute or so when a group enters or leaves the restaurant because it's followed by so much yelling and drums.",

When we spoke to the manager about the ordeal, he simply told us that \"he doesn't need students for his business to survive.\" His service was nothing short of abysmal and the whole situation absolutely ruined my friend's birthday.Besides this, the food was absolutely horrible and the service was terrible.

      "We hit this izakaya on a friday night from 19h00-21h00. The last call for food and alcohol was 20h15. The waiter said that his manager didn't want us to order more alcohol cause he thinks that we drink too fast and was afraid that we would get drunk. (No one puked or acted aggressif, weird or drunk) We were a group of 15 people from outside of town and we were in town for a wedding. This is the first time that we got refuse to be served alcohol in a restaurant, i didn't like this at all, it left me a bitter taste. We are all in our early 30' and we were still so sober that night (we had to pass by the LCBO and continue our predrink) O_0. None of my friends will go back there. There are so many other izakaya that would not patronize us and treat us this way. I think it's very insulting that the manager said to his waiters to stop serving us alcohol. I mean..c'mon we're not kid anymore. It's too bad the action of ONE manager reflects on the whole staff. The waiters was very kind and energetic but the manager himself made a bad call in my opinion. If you want to have fun, come to any izakaya in Montreal city and i GARANTEE you that no will ever refuse to serve you alcohol (as long as you don't puke lol).",

      "Coolest, funnest place ever, Kinka replicates the liveliness and atmosphere of a traditional Izakaya in Japan very well, the staff greets you on entry and exit, all the staff is extraordinarily friendly, the service is quick, and the food was amazing. Our reservation had hand cligraphied cards on them! We ordered fried chicken, torched salmon, takoyaki and black sesame ice cream, they were all superb! Cheaper than most Japanese restaurants with solid food quality and a fun atmosphere, what more can you ask for?\nThe only little complaint i have is the salmon was not as torched (charred) as what we had in Montreal's Kinka, so it was less good, but overall still a place I would return to regularly if I lived in Toronto!",

Staff will find any reason to yell and make noise, whether it's a customer entering or leaving, or a dish comes out of the kitchen, or anything else. Definitely the kind of atmosphere that encourages you to raise your own voices.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the volume, fortunately they also have a patio that is much quieter. During colder seasons, it would be covered up and adequately heated, so the option is available year-round as long as they choose to offer it.\n\nWe came for some mega karaage. I don't know if it's on the regular menu, but they make some pretty good fried chicken. Super crisp skin, nice juicy meat. They have a waiter checking up on the patio frequently enough, with water refills and asking how things are doing.\n\nI don't know how the regular items are like, but if they've got karaage normally I'd come back for more.",

In addition we got the cheese bake mussels and takoyaki. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ramen and said it was comparable to Sensotei. The sashimi was fresh and the appetizers we shared were super tasty. The cheese mussels though are really saucy and rich- just an FYI! \n\nI really enjoyed the environment as it was fun and casual. However the service was slow, but the waitress was really nice - just get their attention if something is needed. Will definitely be coming back. :) \n\nVisited: December 10th 2017",

It was pretty empty actually with only a couple other tables so the service was excellent. Hubby had the salmon don and it was really good. Large portions of fresh chunks of sushi salmon paired with sushi rice and a really delicious sauce on top. Everyone in our group agreed the salmon don was great value. (Comes with miso soup and salad)\nThey have an extensive sake menu and lots of different tapas to try, it's a great lounge spot and hearing the kitchen yelling in Japanese to greet you is lots of fun. :)",

It's incredible Japanese food, the flavors were Umani Central.\n\nWe ordered a few things to try from the menu, the standout dishes were the Karaage and the Seared Tuna. Runner up is the Yakiudon. I suggest you go with 3 - 4 people, so you can order a few items to try. They do offer \"lunch sets\", which are a great variety, but if you want to try more than .a few items, fo with friends.\n\nThe staff is super nice and the even though we came at the end of lunch, you can feel that it's a very lively place.\n\nPro Tip: be careful when eating the takoyaki balls, they will burn your mouth if you don't let them cool down. seriously super hot!! They were great but I did burn the roof of my mouth.",

      "5/5 for sure! Right off the bat, the reservations were very easy to make (made them through YELP), and they even followed up with a confirmation text a few days leading up to the event. \n\nI came here for my birthday with a few of my friends and the experience was phenomenal. As soon as you enter the door, you are greeted with an outburst of japanese waiters who make you feel welcomed. The place is not too big, hence the reason for reservations to be made. \n\nFood - As a group of 6 we decided to split and share a bunch of food items. We tried \n*Karaage - which was HUGE! It came with about 4-6 pieces and they were the size of about a small fist or less, but definitely worth it. \n*Ikapiri - calamari in sweet/spicy like sauce. They sprinkled crispy onions on the top of it, making the texture crispy, yet soft at the same time. \n*Takoyaki - octopus ball, with flour and a piece of octopus in it. Pretty flavourful and good. Presentable. Even texture throughout, but could use a little bit of a bigger piece of octopus on the inside. Be careful when biting into it, it might be a little hot!! Rich in flavour, but not too heavy. \n*Kinoko bibimbap - was better than the kimchi bibimbap in comparison, but both were really good. This bibimbap was focused on mushrooms, with a variation of seaweed. MMMM YUM! We ended up ordering two! \n*Kimchi bibimbap - very flavourful. More focused on flavour rather than spice. It's not too bad, but I prefer the Kinoko bibimbap. \n*Birthday assorted desserts - Came with grapefruit, almond pudding, 2 slices of caramel/coffee roll cake?, and black sesame & coconut icecream. \n\nAMAZING 5/5 QUALITY JAP FOOD EXPERIENCE! Defeinitely would recommend. \n\nDrinks- Try out these FUN drinks if you want to have a blast with your friends. They make it a whole experience and get everybody's attention in the restaurant. This is worth the video recording and definitely worth the try if you come here, you should get at least one of these drinks. THURSDAYS -- $3!! \n*Sake bombs - Sapporo beer & Sake shot sitting on top of chopsticks. \n*Samurai bombs - Sapporo beer & Fruity drink mix & Sake Shot --huge!!\n\nService/Environment - Excellent. Attentive. They explained very well that the table is reserved after us for 9pm which is completely understandable, and still enough time to eat comfortable. They have fast food service, and even if  you order in a trickle (different dishes) -- they can cater to it (but it's better to order everything up front). \n\n\nParking- I parked at the pay for parking right across the restaurant. Very convenient. FUN. \n\nWould 100% come back and recommend it to my friends. It makes you feel like you're in Japan, and you're immersed into their izakaya culture as soon as you walk through the doors. Please try this gem out!",

      "I haven't been here since Guu days but was pleasantly surprised to find their menu hasn't changed much at all. Interior is cozy with dim lighting. The atmosphere is lively and the servers are very enthusiastic so expect lots and lots of shouting when you enter and throughout your whole meal - it's all part of the experience.\n\nFor our drinks we got the Kinka Fizz and the Sky of Tokyo - both cocktails were delicious and refreshing!\n\nWe shared the kinoko bibimbap, chicken karaage, hotate scallops, takoyaki, and salmon tataki. I would highly recommend the kinoko bibimbap - it's basically mushrooms, cheese, and rice served in a stone bowl and it tastes good! The karaage was good but I found the pieces to be too big for my liking. Scallops were so fresh, reminds me of the ones from Japan. The takoyaki is decent and you can't ever go wrong with ordering their salmon tataki served with garlic chips.\n\nFun place to go for a date or with friends! Food-wise I give it 3.5 stars because for me only a few of their dishes are memorable enough to be repeat orders - the rest are decent or average. The portions can also be rather small for the price. I have to say that the drinks are really good here though and same with the service so +0.5 stars for that!",

      "Went for lunch on Wednesday with my 2 friends. The seats were 1/4 filled and it was really warm inside. There were music/songs playing and I felt that the volume was kind of loud. I ordered the Miso ramen + Gyu Carpaccio. My friends ordered the regular size Karaage Don, Gomaae, Tako Wasabi and Donburi with salmon sashimi. \n\nI am a huge ramen lover, but honestly, I didn't appreciate the Miso ramen that I ordered. I'd rather have a ramen at near-by Kinton, Sansotei or Santouka. I usually finish most of the soup whenever I have ramen, but this time I left it half way. \n\nAs for the appetizers, I loved it. Guy Carpaccio was yummy, except that it doesn't look like the picture that has been posted on Yelp by the restaurant. I also think that it is a bit overpriced ($7.50) for 5 thin slices of beef. Tako Wasabi was good too, we could taste the octopus, and there was lots of wasabi. To be enjoyed little by little. \n\nDonburis came with a miso soup and a side salad. Karaage Don came with pieces of fried chicken and the bowl was filled completely. My friend who had the salmon one was still kind of hungry after the meal. So if you're someone who has a good appetite, go with the Karaage Don. \n\nFood: 3.5/5\nPrice: 3/5\nService: 3.75/5",

      "This place is amazing! My friend and I have been coming here every Thursday for more than a week for the $3 sake bombs. Every time we order one, they do the whole sake bomb chant that lights up the entire atmosphere. Pitchers are a bit pricy at around $18, but the atmosphere is super lively. This place always cheers me up. \n\nI also always get the karaage, which is similar to the one you get from Kinton (since owned by same parent restaurant), which is delicious and crispy but there's usually only 4 pieces. The salmon tataki and is delicious and fresh. If you go for your birthday, they'll have a huge board and get the entire restaurant to sing happy birthday for you, which is freaking awesome. \n\ni've also gone for lunch for their cheap $8 shoyu ramen. It's light and the pork is kind of hard to chew, but the noodles are worth the price. They also have a delicious karaage don and I don't know why they don't offer this at kinton, but it's super good!",

      "After a long nap on a Friday evening, I was looking forward to some cozy Japanese food for dinner. We made a reservation for Kinka Izakaya a bit earlier, and luckily the restaurant was busy but not so packed that we didn't have to wait to be seated in this dimly lit, but boisterous little restaurant.\n\nImmediately upon entering the venue, it was clear that the vibe was not unlike a real izakaya--a Japanese pub or tavern--you could find in Japan. The wooden decor, the dim lighting, and the small-plates style of serving all pointed to the same authentic vibe. The servers all greet you when you enter, say goodbye when you leave, and cheer when anyone in the restaurant orders a sake bomb. It's no question that it's all kinds of fun here!\n\nMy friends and I split a decent number of dishes, the most memorable I'll talk about here:\n\n-Gyu Carpaccio: This seared sashimi featured ponzu, wasabi mayo, and garlic chips on top. The meat was tender and the sauce was a mix of rich and acidic, which was a nice balance to the meat.\n-Salmon Tataki: This is the seafood equivalent of the gyu carpaccio. The flavor profile of the sauces were quite similar, but the protein was simply different. Though to be honest, I prefer salmon simply because I like fish more than I like most meats. Regardless, both dishes were quite good and the fattiness of the meat was rich and balanced out well.\n-Karaage: This is your pretty classic Japanese fried chicken. The soy sauce marinade and the garlic mayo was a nice classic dish.\n-Gindara: The grilled miso black cod was surprisingly delicate and delicate in flavor. There were some bones in the dish which wasn't much of a problem, but it was definitely a more delicate dish than what we expected. In comparison to the saba (described below), I think my friends and I preferred the saba.\n-Saba: Yum! I personally love grilled mackerel. Kinka Izakaya does a great (classic) execution of this grilled fish with a bit of salt and lemon on a sizzling dish. The crispy/flaky dichotomy was well done and flavorful.\n-Tonpei Yaki: This egg dish with pan-fried pork, bean sprouts, and cabbage was similar to okonomiyaki. Though to be honest I didn't quite like how they rendered the pork (it was a bit fatty for me), but I still thought the dish and its sauces were executed well.\n-Unagi Doria: This eel over rice as a pretty classic take on an eel donburi. The eel was well done and tasted just as one would expect, but I was a big fan of the rice. The grains felt like they had a little bite to them like brown rice, but overall was flavorful in comparison to most steamed rices that unagi is often served on top of instead.\n\nTo finish all this off, we also split a matcha tiramisu. I'll say I quite appreciated the flavor of it in contrast to the traditional coffee/liqueur flavoring, since this felt a little earthier and lighter in comparison. Looks like it's a seasonal special though, so keep an eye out for it!\n\nThis meal was a wild night and the portions were perfectly sized. Despite getting to sample so much, I wasn't stuffed! Can't wait to come back here for a sampling of their other dishes, or even their gigantic katsu they serve on Wednesday nights. Guess I'll have to make another trip up to Toronto soon...",

      "Pretty solid spot for izakaya fare in Toronto.\n\nMy friend and I came for a late lunch on Monday around 1 pm. I had previously made reservations a couple hours beforehand just in case, but the whole restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived so they weren't really necessary.\n\nThey have a small outdoor seating area on their patio, which is where we opted to sit since it was such a nice day outside. I was pretty hungry since I hadn't eaten all morning, so we shared:\n\n-karaage ($9.90): a little bland but otherwise delicious. Skin was light and crispy and it wasn't too oily\n\n-okonomiyaki ($8.90): comes with 4 pre-cut pieces which makes it great for sharing. Thought this was pretty solid as well\n\n-kalbi ($9.90): a little disappointed in this dish as the kalbi flavor wasn't very strong. I had ordered a bowl of rice to eat with this but didn't finish the full bowl, since the kalbi was a little bit blander than expected\n\n-almond tofu ($4.90): my friend had never had this dessert before but he really liked it. Thick creamy tofu with a delicious almond flavor...yum!!\n\nWe ended up paying ~$60 for this meal for the two of us, which includes a miso soup and a cocktail as well. A bit on the pricey side for lunch, but hey, what's vacation for if not splurging? :D",

Unfortunately the menu on their website is way out of date...so we had to order different dishes to our original plan. When we got the order back to our hotel room we found instead of 2 serves of salmon salad dish they gave us 2 serves of tuna (does that mean they couldn't hear us either!!) not what we wanted at all and the eel dish....well.....where was the eel....did someone forget to put it in the container?!

      "WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nTheir sake bombs. It's a popular drink here! For $5 you get a shot of sake in a cup of beer. But not only that, you get to experience the fun part of having the whole restaurant get all revved up as you take this same bomb challenge. A waiter will yell sake and you yell bomb. After three instances of shouting back and forth, you rumble the table to have the sake shot drop into your beer before downing it in one go. Quite fun!\n\nTheir tapas style dishes are great too. I recommend the sashimi dishes here and the takoyaki too. You can see in my pictures what I had and I loved all the dishes I ordered! \n\nThe ambiance in this restaurant has always been loud and lively so if you're not up for that, this restaurant may not be the best choice for you. Many come here for a birthday celebration or celebrating something because the bigger your group, the more it is when you do a sake bomb. \n\nThe only thing I want to warn you is about the pace of the service. Because they are so busy, sometimes it will take a bit longer for them to get the food to you or they simply forgot about your beer order. So be patient and be prepared to follow up with a waiter on your order!!\n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nThe bill can quickly add up because you want to try everything but a good rule of thumb is to order two dishes per person to start and then order more as you go along your meal! Enjoy the izakaya!!",

      "Very lively atmosphere here with staff that are super enthusiastic! The staff are constantly yelling at full energy for whenever someone enters, exits, an order is read, someone orders a sake bomb, etc. It's truly a bustling environment that gives you a really warm and energetic feeling, but it is very loud. Don't expect to be able to speak to your fellow diners very well without losing your voice.\n\nThe food itself was sort of hit and miss. We ordered the set menu to be able to try a variety of the menu. At $40 a person, it's not too bad (note: each dish portion that comes out is to be shared with all set menu people). The items I really enjoyed were the salmon tataki and kaki mayo. The other items were evenly split into \"okay\" or \"salt explosion\" categories.\n\nI can't quite say if I'd come back again. The food is sort of overpriced for the majority of the items, considering I felt the quality or complexity wasn't there. There are a few things I would come back to try again, but I personally prefer dining environments where I have ease conversing with friends. Food is a social experience for me, so despite the lively and fun environment KINKA offers, it's really too hard to talk to people!",

Since there was only 2 of us, we only ordered a few from their staple menu, baked oysters, takoyaki, karaage, bibimbap with a pint of beer each.\n\nWhile the food came out mostly delicious, the portions have changed - especially apparent in the size of oysters, like one was significantly smaller than the other. The takoyaki wasn't crispy at all on the outside, the chicken sizes weren't similar so a few pieces came out a little pink on the inside. \n\nThe server was a bit hard to flag down, but the few times she came to our table, was friendly and helpful.

      "After 11hrs of terrible weather and driving to Toronto from Albany the wifey and I ended up in here. I have to say I was just as excited to be here as last time. However this time I was there for my Burffday and I was ready to relax and have some fun with my partner in crime. \n\nSo let's get started...Walking in here is a a warm screaming welcome so that's always fun. I was here on a Thursday and it was sake bomb night. If you end up at this place, you have to try at least once. Now I have had sake bombs at a lot of places and I'm sure so have you. But this place it's an experience you must try. It gets loud and every server gets into it and lets just say the birdffday was on its way. \n\nFood was just as I remembered it..Deeelicious for th most part. We had the tuna sashimi, the salmon sashimi, beef carpaccio to start and they were all delicious. Carpaccio was Bomb so def try that. We also got the yellowfin sashimi and wel let's just say same as above, fresh and yummy. We then got the pork belly bao buns and to be fair I am a huge bao bun snob but the pork belly was cooked perfectly and they were excellent. We also got scallop sashimi, the spare ribs and well lots of SAKE...smooth and yummy. \n\nThe only thing we didn't like was the pork dish, it seemed a bit under seasoned and happened to be cold so we had to send it back.  \n\nLastly we got the matcha cheesecake with matcha ice cream and that was mind blowing. It was a perfect cap to the meal and birthday.",

      "Came here for lunch with my sister! Unfortunately, there is less variety at lunch than at dinner, and the portions tend to be quite overpriced. All lunch sets are at a minimum $10.\n\nI ordered the salmon don, which came with three pieces of flame torched salmon, and chopped pieces of salmon marinated with soy sauce. All this sat on a bed of marinated kelp, on top of the white rice. The marinade was very good but slightly salty, and soaked right through to the rice. The salmon was very tasty, but quite stringy and chewy (definitely consisted of the rougher cuts of meat). The seared salmon had a very rich and delicious smokey flavour. As this was a set, it came with miso soup and salad (which was topped with crunchy fried daikon chips).\n\nMy sister got the karaage don, which came with roughly five pieces of small karaage and a bit of lettuce. It was okay, but definitely not their best that I've had. The batter was slightly thicker than what I remember.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but not amazing. Next time, I might just come for dinner instead.",

      "One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Think of it as Japanese tapas food. Great place for groups as the dishes are smaller and meant for sharing so you are able to try a lot of different things. I've taken a lot of people here and it's always a hit. \n\nEverything on the menu is great, but the must tries are the Brie Cheese (deep fried cheese), Ebimayo (deep fried prawns), Karaage (deep fried chicken), Kakimayo (baked oyster with cheese). These are my favourite dishes and always crowd favourites. Other notable mentions include the udon and bibimbap! \n\nFeeling boozy? All of their cocktails are great, but if you want something more adventurous get the Sake Bomb. If that's not enough try the Seven Samurai. Both options, get ready for some shots, chugging and lots of yelling! Definitely something to try at least once!",

      "If you're in any way an introvert that hates attention, OR one easily overstimulated by loud noises or crowds, I would steer clear of Kinka Izakaya. But, if you can roll with such things and you enjoy delicious Japanese food, I highly recommend this place.\n\nWhen you walk into the joint be prepared, EVERYONE gets a welcome. There's shouting, cheering and more in Japanese. A lot of the seating is communal but we were lucky to grab a table for two fairly easily on a Saturday night. We had to wait about 10 minutes but a light stroll down the street kept us occupied until they called us to let us know our table was ready. \n\nAs the name suggests, it's izakaya-style dining, which means we plowed through a large number of plates at our table. Some highlights: salmon tataki (seared atlantic salmon sashimi w/ ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips & scallion), the salmon collar, karaage (deep fried soy sauce\nmarinated chicken w/ garlic mayo), and the karubi (grilled salt & pepper beef short ribs w/ scallion sauce). But everything we had was a winner.\n\nPrice isn't too terrible either for a special night out. For the two of us we walked out of there stuffed for around $70. I've certainly spent more on less food of lesser quality in Toronto, so this was a nice surprise.",

However, everything we've ordered has been very tasty.  Some of their highlights include lobster sashimi (which they have in the summer sometimes), their almond tofu (to die for), and their karaage chicken (because who can go wrong with fried chicken)? \n\nThis is certainly a very loud place to be at with all the patrons talking and the waiters and waitresses yelling every few seconds when someone comes in.

      'This restaurant boasts unique and sophisticated Japanese food but the flavors weren\'t strong enough to leave an impression. The noise level and long shared picnic tables and shouting made it oddly reminiscent of a German Biergarten. At the end of the night. The waiters approached tables near us no less than 6 times over the time we were there to boisterously yell some rhymes or sayings that encourage the table to drink whatever they ordered that I\'m guessing comes with yelling on the side. The waiter did not speak enough English to understand our order. The rapini with sesame sauce that other reviewers rave about was just that -- some boiled spinach with a dark sesame sauce on it. The Gyozo were unremarkable. The mackerel fishy. The black cod was super tender and delicious with subtle flavors. It was, as some have written, "casual" and "super lively." The yelling was just too much.',

      "I want to preface this review by saying that this place looks fun to visit as a large group. They have big communal tables, lots of noise, and sake bombs galore. I came alone (I was visiting Toronto for a few days), and this was just not what I was looking for. First, it was very loud. The gimmick is that the servers shout in Japanese whenever someone comes through the door, leaves, places an order, there's an order up, or gets a sake bomb. In the latter case, the servers chant while the person bangs loudly on the table. Again - probably fun if you're into that kind of thing, but otherwise just very loud. I ordered two things - the yuzu tofu (similar to agadashi tofu) which arrived pretty soggy unfortunately, and the special oyster hot pot, which had exactly one oyster and the rest was cabbage (taste was okay though). I was also very crowded. On the bright side, the servers were very polite and attentive and clearly working very hard. I just can't really recommend this place based on the atmosphere or the food.",

      "This is a typical Izakaya but overall I had a just average experience.\n\nThe ambience is full of people screaming at the top of their lungs and drumming, which was pretty annoying if you're trying to talk at all. I did like how in summers they have an outdoors dining patio area, which is much better and quieter than the inside. The poor staff were literally losing their voice from yelling.\n\nThe food was standard izakaya fare. Pretty good but nothing stood out. The more adventurous sounding menu items like the fried pumpkin croquette was just heavy and weirdly flavoured. I wouldn't say bad, but nothing I'd order again.\n\nThe service was adequate since they always have a full house. We were able to get in with some waiting without making any reservations on a Friday night around 6 PM.\n\nOverall I'd rate them much higher if there wasn't so much unnecessary screaming. I get the fun and loud environment part of it but there's a limit. Having a normal conversation, we would get interrupted every minute or so when a group enters or leaves the restaurant because it's followed by so much yelling and drums.",

When we spoke to the manager about the ordeal, he simply told us that \"he doesn't need students for his business to survive.\" His service was nothing short of abysmal and the whole situation absolutely ruined my friend's birthday.Besides this, the food was absolutely horrible and the service was terrible.

      "Maybe I should have read the other reviews more carefully. But I do regret going here for dinner. The place was REALLY noisy. Loud clubbing music, loud chanting of service crew all the time. After eating, my eats were overwhelmed. I thought I almost had heart attack at some occasions during dinner\nMaybe it suits some other folks but definitely not me!\n\nThey earned two stars on the food. Food was good but not the environment, at least not for me",

      "This place is extremely loud.  Don't come here for a quiet talk because you will be drowned out by the music and waiters yelling.   It feels like I am walking into a nightclub because it is just so loud.   Luckily, we got the tables outside.   We went there during the Mega-Karaage night so it was cheap chicken thighs.   It takes them a while to make and fry the chicken thighs.  Once they arrived, it was arranged on top of each other.  The chicken was alright.  Not that moist.  The skin was crispy.   I ended up eating 3 of them and I was full.  I think I ended up spending about $10-$15 for it.\n\nI think they really need to turn down the loud music.   If I were to sit inside, I'd go deaf.",
