      "Coolest, funnest place ever, Kinka replicates the liveliness and atmosphere of a traditional Izakaya in Japan very well, the staff greets you on entry and exit, all the staff is extraordinarily friendly, the service is quick, and the food was amazing. Our reservation had hand cligraphied cards on them! We ordered fried chicken, torched salmon, takoyaki and black sesame ice cream, they were all superb! Cheaper than most Japanese restaurants with solid food quality and a fun atmosphere, what more can you ask for?\nThe only little complaint i have is the salmon was not as torched (charred) as what we had in Montreal's Kinka, so it was less good, but overall still a place I would return to regularly if I lived in Toronto!",

      "When people say it's lively...it is certainly lively. Staff will find any reason to yell and make noise, whether it's a customer entering or leaving, or a dish comes out of the kitchen, or anything else. Definitely the kind of atmosphere that encourages you to raise your own voices.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the volume, fortunately they also have a patio that is much quieter. During colder seasons, it would be covered up and adequately heated, so the option is available year-round as long as they choose to offer it.\n\nWe came for some mega karaage. I don't know if it's on the regular menu, but they make some pretty good fried chicken. Super crisp skin, nice juicy meat. They have a waiter checking up on the patio frequently enough, with water refills and asking how things are doing.\n\nI don't know how the regular items are like, but if they've got karaage normally I'd come back for more.",

In addition we got the cheese bake mussels and takoyaki. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ramen and said it was comparable to Sensotei. The sashimi was fresh and the appetizers we shared were super tasty. The cheese mussels though are really saucy and rich- just an FYI! \n\nI really enjoyed the environment as it was fun and casual. However the service was slow, but the waitress was really nice - just get their attention if something is needed. Will definitely be coming back. :) \n\nVisited: December 10th 2017",

It's incredible Japanese food, the flavors were Umani Central.\n\nWe ordered a few things to try from the menu, the standout dishes were the Karaage and the Seared Tuna. Runner up is the Yakiudon. I suggest you go with 3 - 4 people, so you can order a few items to try. They do offer \"lunch sets\", which are a great variety, but if you want to try more than .a few items, fo with friends.\n\nThe staff is super nice and the even though we came at the end of lunch, you can feel that it's a very lively place.\n\nPro Tip: be careful when eating the takoyaki balls, they will burn your mouth if you don't let them cool down. seriously super hot!!

      "I haven't been here since Guu days but was pleasantly surprised to find their menu hasn't changed much at all. Interior is cozy with dim lighting. The atmosphere is lively and the servers are very enthusiastic so expect lots and lots of shouting when you enter and throughout your whole meal - it's all part of the experience.\n\nFor our drinks we got the Kinka Fizz and the Sky of Tokyo - both cocktails were delicious and refreshing!\n\nWe shared the kinoko bibimbap, chicken karaage, hotate scallops, takoyaki, and salmon tataki. I would highly recommend the kinoko bibimbap - it's basically mushrooms, cheese, and rice served in a stone bowl and it tastes good! The karaage was good but I found the pieces to be too big for my liking. Scallops were so fresh, reminds me of the ones from Japan. The takoyaki is decent and you can't ever go wrong with ordering their salmon tataki served with garlic chips.\n\nFun place to go for a date or with friends! Food-wise I give it 3.5 stars because for me only a few of their dishes are memorable enough to be repeat orders - the rest are decent or average. The portions can also be rather small for the price. I have to say that the drinks are really good here though and same with the service so +0.5 stars for that!",

      "I'm a huge fan of Japanese food - especially izakaya-style dishes. So when our original lunch plans for our first day in Toronto fell through, I immediately put Kinka on our plans.\n \nMaking a reservation is super easy online via Yelp and when we arrived around 1pm, we had our pick of tables. Waitress was super friendly and all our dishes arrived on time.\n \nWe started off with an order of takoyaki to share. Honestly, it was one of the best takoyaki's I have had outside of Japan. A+ for their takoyaki! 10/10 would eat again.\n \nI had their salmon don lunch set, which comes with a side salad and a miso soup. BF had their gyu don lunch set, which also comes with the same sides. He couldn't decide on whether or not he wanted the gyu don or the karaage don, so we also got an order of the karaage on the side.\n \nThe lunch sets are a fantastic deal - you get a rice bowl with a side salad and a miso soup for $10 ($11 if you get the salmon). My salmon don was fresh and had so much salmon! The karaage was super moist and juicy on the inside but very crisp and crunchy on the outside.\n \nIf you're not a super hearty eater, one don and a split appetizer should be enough to fill you up. We both struggled a little bit to finish up our karaage. In the end, we had to leave behind some rice from our bowls.",

      "Pretty solid spot for izakaya fare in Toronto.\n\nMy friend and I came for a late lunch on Monday around 1 pm. I had previously made reservations a couple hours beforehand just in case, but the whole restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived so they weren't really necessary.\n\nThey have a small outdoor seating area on their patio, which is where we opted to sit since it was such a nice day outside. I was pretty hungry since I hadn't eaten all morning, so we shared:\n\n-karaage ($9.90): a little bland but otherwise delicious. Skin was light and crispy and it wasn't too oily\n\n-okonomiyaki ($8.90): comes with 4 pre-cut pieces which makes it great for sharing. Thought this was pretty solid as well\n\n-kalbi ($9.90): a little disappointed in this dish as the kalbi flavor wasn't very strong. I had ordered a bowl of rice to eat with this but didn't finish the full bowl, since the kalbi was a little bit blander than expected\n\n-almond tofu ($4.90): my friend had never had this dessert before but he really liked it. Thick creamy tofu with a delicious almond flavor...yum!!\n\nWe ended up paying ~$60 for this meal for the two of us, which includes a miso soup and a cocktail as well. A bit on the pricey side for lunch, but hey, what's vacation for if not splurging? :D",

First off, the atmosphere was really fun.  They offer sake bombs so you will hear people screaming and banging on the tables every few minutes.  The food was served tapas style and I got to try about 6-7 different dishes which were all really good.  The ones that stood out to me were the oysters(kakimayo), salmon tataki, and the yaki udon.

The staff are constantly yelling at full energy for whenever someone enters, exits, an order is read, someone orders a sake bomb, etc. It's truly a bustling environment that gives you a really warm and energetic feeling, but it is very loud. Don't expect to be able to speak to your fellow diners very well without losing your voice.\n\nThe food itself was sort of hit and miss. We ordered the set menu to be able to try a variety of the menu. At $40 a person, it's not too bad (note: each dish portion that comes out is to be shared with all set menu people). The items I really enjoyed were the salmon tataki and kaki mayo. The other items were evenly split into \"okay\" or \"salt explosion\" categories.\n\nI can't quite say if I'd come back again. The food is sort of overpriced for the majority of the items, considering I felt the quality or complexity wasn't there. There are a few things I would come back to try again, but I personally prefer dining environments where I have ease conversing with friends. Food is a social experience for me, so despite the lively and fun environment KINKA offers, it's really too hard to talk to people!",

All lunch sets are at a minimum $10.\n\nI ordered the salmon don, which came with three pieces of flame torched salmon, and chopped pieces of salmon marinated with soy sauce. All this sat on a bed of marinated kelp, on top of the white rice. The marinade was very good but slightly salty, and soaked right through to the rice. The salmon was very tasty, but quite stringy and chewy (definitely consisted of the rougher cuts of meat). The seared salmon had a very rich and delicious smokey flavour. As this was a set, it came with miso soup and salad (which was topped with crunchy fried daikon chips).\n\nMy sister got the karaage don, which came with roughly five pieces of small karaage and a bit of lettuce. It was okay, but definitely not their best that I've had. The batter was slightly thicker than what I remember.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but not amazing. Next time, I might just come for dinner instead.",

These are my favourite dishes and always crowd favourites. Other notable mentions include the udon and bibimbap! \n\nFeeling boozy? All of their cocktails are great, but if you want something more adventurous get the Sake Bomb. If that's not enough try the Seven Samurai. Both options, get ready for some shots, chugging and lots of yelling! Definitely something to try at least once!",

      "If you're in any way an introvert that hates attention, OR one easily overstimulated by loud noises or crowds, I would steer clear of Kinka Izakaya. But, if you can roll with such things and you enjoy delicious Japanese food, I highly recommend this place.\n\nWhen you walk into the joint be prepared, EVERYONE gets a welcome. There's shouting, cheering and more in Japanese. A lot of the seating is communal but we were lucky to grab a table for two fairly easily on a Saturday night. We had to wait about 10 minutes but a light stroll down the street kept us occupied until they called us to let us know our table was ready. \n\nAs the name suggests, it's izakaya-style dining, which means we plowed through a large number of plates at our table. Some highlights: salmon tataki (seared atlantic salmon sashimi w/ ponzu, wasabi mayo, garlic chips & scallion), the salmon collar, karaage (deep fried soy sauce\nmarinated chicken w/ garlic mayo), and the karubi (grilled salt & pepper beef short ribs w/ scallion sauce). But everything we had was a winner.\n\nPrice isn't too terrible either for a special night out. For the two of us we walked out of there stuffed for around $70. I've certainly spent more on less food of lesser quality in Toronto, so this was a nice surprise.",

      "This is a typical Izakaya but overall I had a just average experience.\n\nThe ambience is full of people screaming at the top of their lungs and drumming, which was pretty annoying if you're trying to talk at all. I did like how in summers they have an outdoors dining patio area, which is much better and quieter than the inside. The poor staff were literally losing their voice from yelling.\n\nThe food was standard izakaya fare. Pretty good but nothing stood out. The more adventurous sounding menu items like the fried pumpkin croquette was just heavy and weirdly flavoured. I wouldn't say bad, but nothing I'd order again.\n\nThe service was adequate since they always have a full house. We were able to get in with some waiting without making any reservations on a Friday night around 6 PM.\n\nOverall I'd rate them much higher if there wasn't so much unnecessary screaming. I get the fun and loud environment part of it but there's a limit. Having a normal conversation, we would get interrupted every minute or so when a group enters or leaves the restaurant because it's followed by so much yelling and drums.",
